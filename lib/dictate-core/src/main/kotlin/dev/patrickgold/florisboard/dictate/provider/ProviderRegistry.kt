    // the offline Whisper runner that needs no key and no network. The other presets stay defined
    // above so code referencing them by name still compiles, they are simply not offered.
    //
    // Being in this list is what gives a provider the key manager, the multi key ring, the tester
    // and the parser, all of it for free — and byId() only looks here, so a provider that is not
    // listed has its keys silently dropped on import. That cost a build once. It is also exactly
    // why the list is short: a provider offered but unusable is a line that has to be read and
    // then ruled out, every time.

     * The providers this build actually offers.

     * A preset defined above but absent from this list does not exist as far as the app is
     * concerned: `byId` returns null for it, and `MaKeyImport` skips any provider `byId` cannot
     * find. That is the whole reason a Groq key could not be stored.
     *
     * Gemini is out, at Marko's instruction. Its preset is left defined above rather than deleted,
     * because deleting it would take the model-picker branch and the icon mapping with it for the
     * sake of a few unread lines — and because unregistering is the reversible half of the change.
     * A stored Gemini key is not erased by this; it stops being shown and stops being importable.
