/**
 * What AssemblyAI itself will say about a key, beyond "it works".
 *
 * Marko asked whether a key test could report more than a green light. It can, and this is exactly
 * how far it goes, checked against the live API rather than hoped for:
 *
 * - **`GET /v2/transcript`** lists the transcripts made with that key: id, status, created,
 *   completed, error. Up to 200 a page, sorted newest first, and **the last 90 days only**. That is
 *   real server-side history, so it counts work done from the laptop and from any other device,
 *   which the app's own ledger cannot see.
 * - **There is no usage or balance endpoint.** `/v2/usage`, `/v2/billing` and `/v2/account/usage`
 *   are all 404. `/v2/account` answers `200 {}` to an invalid key, so it returns an empty object to
 *   anybody and tells us nothing; it is not the balance endpoint a scanning vendor's page suggests
 *   it is. The balance lives on AssemblyAI's billing page and nowhere else.
 * - **The list carries no `audio_duration`.** That field is on the individual transcript, so minutes
 *   would cost one request per transcript: two hundred round trips to total one page, on a phone, on
 *   a settings screen. Not worth it, and not done. Minutes come from the local ledger, which knows
 *   them already because the app made the recordings.
 *
 * So the honest split is: **the service says how many and when, the ledger says how long and what it
 * cost.** Neither is guessed and neither pretends to be the other.
