# TTT (light) — handoff and development plan

> **This repository is TTT (light), a fork.** Only the identity table below has been rewritten so

Written at build 88, updated at build 160, forked at build 160. Sixteen builds went by without an
update once, so check `git log -- HANDOFF.md` against `git log` before trusting it.

## 1. What this is

An Android voice keyboard. Forked from DevEmperor's **Dictate**, which is itself built on Patrick
Goldinger's **FlorisBoard**. Almost nothing of the original dictation code survives; the FlorisBoard
keyboard engine underneath is largely intact.

| | |
|---|---|
| Repo | `markoboskoauroville/TTT_LIGHT` (forked from `markoboskoauroville/DictateKeyboard`) |
| Package | `com.mantraproductions.tttlight` — **never** `com.mantraproductions.voicetype`, which would replace the full app instead of sitting beside it |
| Signing | its own keystore, secrets `TTT_LIGHT_KEYSTORE` and `TTT_LIGHT_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`. Different app, different key |
| APK | `ttt-light-build-N.apk`, no ampersand in the name |
| Build | push to `main` → GitHub Actions → signed APK on the releases page |
| Owner | Marko Boško, Mantra Productions |
| Theme pack | `markoboskoauroville/auroville-florisboard-theme`, published v2.0.0 |

The working tree used across these sessions is a shallow clone at `/home/claude/kb`. A GitHub token
lives at `/mnt/user-data/uploads/github_token.txt` — **never print it**; scrub every command's output
with `sed "s/$(tr -d ' \t\n\r' < /mnt/user-data/uploads/github_token.txt)/***REDACTED***/g"`.

## 2. Rules that are not negotiable

**The name.** The app is **TTT&LLL**. That is what it is called everywhere: the launcher, the
keyboard switcher, the settings title, the release title. It stands for **Talk to Type** and
**Look, Listen, Learn**, the two halves of what it does, and About is the one place the initials
are spelled out, under the short name, so somebody meeting them for the first time can work out
what they mean without asking. Mantra Voice Type became Talk to Type at build 109, and Talk to
Type became TTT&LLL at build 118 when the reader gained a name of its own.

The APK filename is `ttt-lll-build-N.apk` with no ampersand in it. An ampersand is only legal in
a URL escaped, and a download link that needs escaping is one that breaks when it is pasted into
a chat.

**The name must never be translated.** Forty locale files inherited from the fork still carried
`app_name` as `Dictate`, so a phone set to Croatian or German showed the old fork name on the
launcher no matter what the default said. Those overrides are removed and `app_name` is marked
`translatable="false"`, so a future translation import cannot bring them back. If the launcher
ever shows the wrong name again, look for a `values-xx/strings.xml` that has grown an `app_name`
back. The **package id stays `com.mantraproductions.voicetype`** and must not be changed:
Android treats a new package as a different app, so changing it would install alongside the old one
and abandon every API key, preference and the learned n-gram model rather than upgrading. The
package id is not visible to Marko; the launcher name and the APK filename are, and those are what
changed.

**Releases.** The two newest releases may exist, never more. CI deletes everything older after each
successful publish. Two rather than one because a link already handed over dies the moment the next
push publishes, and a one line change to a document is enough to cause that; it happened at build 90.
Two is still bounded, so an old APK never sits there long enough to be mistaken for the current one.

**Version codes.** CI passes `1000 + run_number`. The offset is permanent. Lowering it makes a build
look older than one already installed, and Android refuses the install — this happened at build 62
and produced a misleading "package appears to be invalid" dialog.

**Design language.** Near-black surfaces. Warm gold ink `#E8B15C`. Colour is reserved for state, never
decoration. Red `#9B3B33` means recording and nothing else means red. Green `#6FA85A` means a
modifier is locked. Selection is shown by a gold outline stroke, never a filled block. No pulsing,
breathing or scaling animation anywhere. Minimum text on buttons.

**Every key is styled the same.** Enter had its own fill, ink and border and the space bar had dimmer
ink; both are gone. Nothing gets decorative special treatment. Per-key font sizes stay, because
`ctrl` and `?123` are words rather than letters and have to fit the key they are written on, which is
fitting rather than decorating. An icon that cannot say what a key does is replaced by words: this is
why no row-set button in db has one.

**Croatian and English only, permanently.** Two languages, installed automatically, no choice
offered, no auto-detect, no other layouts or popup mappings. If a future request needs another
language it is a decision to be taken deliberately, not a file quietly added back.

**The scheme is baked in.** `ThemeManager.evaluateActiveThemeName()` returns Sunrise and reads no
preference. The day and night theme settings, the four modes and the sunrise and sunset times are
gone from the interface. Do not reintroduce a theme picker. The Snygg loader underneath stays,
because it is what draws every key; only the choosing is removed. A side effect worth knowing: a
saved theme in internal storage can no longer shadow the bundled stylesheet, which used to make an
edit to `sunrise.json` fail silently.

**The status line.** Small, gold, monospace, from `MaStatusFontSize` and `MaStatusFontFamily` in
`LegacyDictateLayout.kt`. Both views read those two values so they cannot drift apart again.

**Prose in commits and replies.** No dashes or em dashes as connectors. Months as numbers, never
names.

---

## 3. Traps that have caught me repeatedly

Each of these cost at least one wasted build. They are listed because they will catch the next
session too.

**A changed default never reaches a written preference.** Changing `default =` in `AppPrefs` does
nothing for an install that already has a value. Every such change needs a one-shot pass in
`DictateLegacyMigrator` called from `FlorisApplication`, each with **its own flag**. Do not bump an
older flag to re-run its pass: that re-runs everything in it, including the accent colour and the
action row order, and silently overwrites anything set by hand since. Passes so far: `v13` rows,
`v14` panel, `v15` removals, `v17` languages, `v18` dashboard order, `v19` paste position, `v20`
clipboard and AP.

**A migration that reads extension resources runs before they exist.** Migrations run while the
preference store loads; `extensionManager.init()` runs afterwards. The Croatian subtype pass looked
up the bundled subtype presets, found an empty list, added nothing, and marked itself done, so
Croatian was missing for three builds while the code looked correct. Build subtypes from literal
values, or run after the extension manager.

**Two constants can hold the same key code and nothing will warn you.** `MA_QUICK_RECORD` was `-232`
and so was `IME_HIDE_UI`. A `when` takes the branch written first, so quick record never ran, while
the label lookup was ordered the other way and named the key correctly on a tile that did the wrong
thing. After adding any key code, re-run the collision check over `KeyCode.kt`. `INTERNAL_MAX` and
`CTRL` both being `-1` is intentional; anything else is a bug.

**Something else may be overwriting the obvious place.** The enter key stayed orange through four
attempts at editing the stylesheet because `rememberSnyggTheme(..., accentColor)` *replaces*
`--primary` at load time. Rules that must not be repainted use literal colours, not `var(--primary)`.
When editing the obvious place has no effect twice, find what is overwriting it.

**A nullable property from another module will not smart-cast.** `if (probe.kind != null)` then
using `probe.kind` fails to compile with *"Smart cast is impossible, because kind is a public API
property declared in different module"*. It looks like ordinary null-checking and it is the only
error in an otherwise clean build, so it reads as something exotic. `dictate-core` is a separate
Gradle module from `app`, so every nullable property crossing that line needs pulling into a local
first. Cost builds 143 and 144.

**Deleting a line with a regex leaves its annotations behind.** Removing `object DictateLanguages`
from `Routes.kt` with a line-matching pattern left its `@Serializable` and `@Deeplink` sitting above
the next route, which then carried two of each and failed with *"This annotation is not repeatable"*
rather than anything mentioning the thing that was deleted. Delete the whole declaration including
the annotations above it, and grep for a `@Deeplink` not followed by an `object` before pushing.
Cost build 148.

**Never test for an import with `in`.** `"import androidx.compose.runtime.remember" in source` is
**true** when the file only has `rememberCoroutineScope`, because the first string is a substring of
the second. The missing import then cascades: `remember` unresolved makes the value it returns
untyped, which makes the `forEach` lambda's parameter uninferable, which makes every composable call
inside it report *"@Composable invocations can only happen from the context of a @Composable
function"*. Eleven errors, one cause, and none of the eleven names it. Compare whole stripped lines.
`/home/claude/importcheck.py <files>` does this and also checks `getValue`/`setValue` for `by`
delegates. Cost build 152.

**A dynamic height belongs only where the thing is drawn.** The strip going dynamic at build 147 was
correct for the typing view and leaked into three places that never draw a Smartbar at all. `Smartbar()`
is called from `TextInputLayout` and **nowhere else**; the panels, the reader, the clipboard, media,
history, the transcribe view and the GIF panel only ask `panelUiHeight`/`imeUiHeight` to answer *how
tall is the keyboard I am replacing*. Feeding them the dynamic answer shrank the reader by a row
precisely because a reader never has suggestions, and the reader then subtracts a further fixed
`smartbarHeight` on top, which is two rows of page gone and the control row pushed off the bottom.
There are now two functions and the distinction is the fix: `smartbarUiHeight`/`imeUiHeight` for what
is on screen, `smartbarLayoutHeight`/`imeUiLayoutHeight` for what shape the keyboard is. Anything that
does not call `Smartbar()` wants the second. Cost the reader between builds 147 and 156, and would
have made the transcribe view jump a row at the instant a recording started.

**Icon imports.** `Icons.Default.X` needs `...icons.filled.X`; `Icons.Outlined.X` needs
`...icons.outlined.X`. Importing both `filled.X` and `outlined.X` is a name clash and will not
compile. Use `/home/claude/iconcheck.py <files>` — it checks both. Also verify any icon name is
already used elsewhere in the project before trusting it.

**Kotlin `\uXXXX` escapes take four hex digits.** Anything outside the Basic Multilingual Plane needs
a surrogate pair, so pick BMP glyphs.

**Verify against reality, not memory.** Key codes, function signatures and parameter names have all
bitten me when assumed. `TOGGLE_ONE_HANDED_MODE_LEFT` does not exist; one-handed mode is
`TOGGLE_COMPACT_LAYOUT`. `ListPreference` has no `summary` parameter.

**A panel drawn by one view does not exist in the other.** db set its flag from the transcribe view
and appeared on the typing keyboard, which was not on screen, and the flag stayed set so the next
trip to the keyboard opened a panel nobody asked for. Anything that covers the keyboard must be
drawn by both views.

**Commit messages go through a file.** `git commit -m` with an apostrophe in the text breaks shell
quoting and the commit is lost. Write the message to `/tmp/msg.txt` and use `-F`.

**The handoff rule was broken for sixteen builds** between 118 and 134, and it was only caught
because Marko asked. Nothing warns you: the APK builds green, the feature works, and the document
quietly describes an app that no longer exists. It is worse than no document, because the next
session reads it and believes it. Update it in the SAME push as the code, every time, and if you
find yourself several builds behind, write the gap up honestly rather than only the newest change.

**Before pushing**, run the brace balance check (`/home/claude/kbal.py`, rewrite it if the sandbox has
reset), a sweep for `R.string.*` references with no definition (they live in `strings.xml` *and*
`strings_dont_translate.xml`), a JSON parse of any edited asset, and the key code collision check.
Verify every icon name is already used elsewhere in the project. Expect roughly one CI failure per
non-trivial change anyway; there is no Kotlin compiler in the sandbox.

## 4. Where the code lives

```
dictate/
  DictateController.kt      recording, transcription, prompts, history, recasing
  MaCase.kt                 the four letter cases, shared by buttons and pipeline

  settings/dictate/DbEditorScreen.kt        the db editor

  settings/dictate/MaNgramSetting.kt
```

**The audio pipeline**, settled and not to be revisited without reason: capture at the device's best
rate (48 kHz where available) → resample to 16 kHz mono with a windowed-sinc filter → encode AAC →
send. Each step deletes what it replaces. Opus was removed: Android's own encoder produced files that
transcribed slowly, while FFmpeg's Opus of the same audio did not.

## 5. The plan

### Shipped since this document was last accurate (builds 89 to 104)

Read the commit messages for the reasoning; each one says why, not just what.

- **Ctrl and modifier locking.** Ctrl replaced `?123` in the corner; tap arms, long press locks, tap
  releases. Gold armed, green locked, with an outline rather than a fill. `Ctrl+A/C/X/V/Z`, plus
  `Ctrl+Shift+Z` and `Ctrl+Y`; other letters fall through to a real ctrl+key event. Shift locked also
  makes arrows extend the selection, through the existing `isManualSelectionMode`.
- **Shift is one arrow in three weights**, drawn in the project (`ic_ma_shift*.xml`). The Material
  set has no hollow arrow without a bar.
- **Volume keys.** Up starts and sends. Down cancels while recording, and switches language when
  idle.
- **One language for the whole app.** `MaLanguage` is the only place the transcription language or
  the keyboard subtype is written. Croatian and English install on first run; there is no language
  screen in Settings and no auto-detect.
- **Croatian and English only on disk.** 178 asset files removed; keyboard assets 552 kB to 212 kB.
  Croatian diacritics live in the `hr` popup mapping, not in a layout: c gives č ć, s gives š, z
  gives ž, d gives đ. Do not touch that file.
- **One-handed mode and the floating window removed**, including the upstream migration that kept
  adding the floating button back.
- **The suggestion strip is only suggestions.** The microphone moved into the copy row as the view
  swap, holding it opens db, and the language badge is typed like a candidate.
- **The copy and paste row is shared by both views**, drawn by the same composable.
- **db**: the dashboard. Row sets first, named in words with no icons, a close key, drawn by both
  views, and a full editor at Settings → Keyboard extras → db.
- **The number row** has five sets, and every digit types an assignable second symbol on long press,
  underscore by default, editable in Settings.
- **Personal n-gram prediction.** See `nlp/MaNgram*.kt`.

### Also shipped since (builds 105 to 110)

- **Retry waits scale with the upload size** and with the attempt, capped at twenty seconds. They
  were three seconds flat, so a long dictation burned all its attempts in ten seconds while the
  signal was merely poor. The status line says *waiting to retry*, not *retrying*.
- **The scheme is baked in.** Sunrise always, no picker, see the rule above.
- **Snippets**, see below.
- **Renamed to Talk to Type (TTT)** at build 109, then to **TTT&LLL** at build 118. Package id
  unchanged through both, see the rule above.

### Shipped since (builds 119 to 134)

Sixteen builds landed before this section was written, which is itself the lesson: the handoff rule
was broken quietly and nobody noticed until Marko asked. Check `git log -- HANDOFF.md` against
`git log` before believing this document is current.

- **The clipboard became a note keeper.** Long-press an entry offers **Edit**, which rewrites it in
  place keeping the same id and pin and taking a fresh timestamp. An **X** closes the panel and a
  **plus** under it writes an entry by hand. The editor has no caret and no selection: text is added
  and removed at the end only, because a caret needs hit testing, a selection model and cursor keys
  rerouted away from the app.
- **The feature row**, along the very bottom of both views, then rebuilt three times. See *Three
  zones* below for what it is now.
- **Zone two is not composed at all** rather than filtered row by row. The first attempt removed rows
  from the keyboard arrangement, which made the keys vanish while `keyboardUiHeight` went on
  counting four rows, so the space stayed. Two pieces of arithmetic had to agree and did not. Not
  composing the keyboard returns its height exactly, with no arithmetic to disagree.
- **The mic is what makes closing the keyboard safe.** With zone two shut, no key anywhere else
  reaches the dictation screen, so the way between views must live in the row that always survives.
- **The fold key lives in the arrow strip**, at the left end, and is the fifth glyph there. Opening
  is a **one second hold with a buzz**; closing is a tap. `MaFlatKey` fired on touch *down*, which is
  right for a repeating arrow and wrong for anything that changes the shape of the keyboard.
- **Modifier locks buzz.** The haptic existed but was wired to the long press in `TextKeyboardLayout`,
  so locking caps by double tap or by the cycle felt nothing. It now fires on the state change in
  `KeyboardManager`, the single point every route into a lock passes through, and is gated only on
  haptics being on at all rather than on the long-press switch.
- **AP is timed 100, 100, 500**: a short lead before the select and before the delete, then half a
  second before the paste. It originally waited once, for a third of a second, and not at all after
  the select, and it failed silently in some apps. The waits are deliberately unequal, because only
  the paste was being dropped; the first two steps just need the field to have noticed. The input
  connection is refetched at every step, since a field can be replaced underneath a macro.
- **The app name is never translated.** Forty locale files still carried `app_name` as `Dictate`, so
  a phone set to Croatian or German showed the old fork name on the launcher whatever the default
  said. All removed, and `app_name` is now `translatable="false"`.

### LLL, the reader: shipped at build 128

The whole chain works end to end and is in the APK. Clipboard text is cleaned of Markdown and
addresses, cut into sentences, spoken by one of four Edge voices, the word boundaries are mapped onto
the visible characters, moved again onto the real decoded waveform, and a highlight position ticks at
40 ms against the player.

- **The engine lives in `markoboskoauroville/MA_READER_ENGINE`**, package
  `dev.mantraproductions.reader.engine`, mounted as the `:engine` Gradle module from the `engine-repo`
  submodule. CI checks out submodules. 126 tests, one of which speaks a real Croatian sentence to
  Microsoft on every push and once a night.
- `MaEdgeVoice` speaks, `MaAlign` maps boundaries to characters, `MaText` cleans and splits,
  `MaWaveform` moves every word onto where it is actually spoken.
- **App side**: `MaPcm` decodes with MediaCodec, which is the one piece that cannot live in the
  engine, and `MaReader` orchestrates one sentence at a time with a disk cache keyed by text and
  voice. `MaReaderLayout` is the view, reached by `ImeUiMode.READER`.
- **The zero-duration fix is in the app, not the engine.** The engine merges a number with the word
  after it, so `8. mjesec` arrives as one boundary and the number ends up lit for zero seconds.
  Adjacent words sharing a start now split the span between them, in `MaReader.spread`. The ports
  stay faithful to the Python; presentation rules belong on the side that presents.
- **Still to do on the reader**: nothing blocking. Worth watching on the device is whether the first
  sentence starts fast enough to feel like reading rather than loading.

### Three zones, and the keys that survive a fold: shipped at build 138, reordered at 139

Marko drew three lines across a screenshot of the keyboard and asked for the parts they cut it into
to be switchable one by one. The row is now eight keys:

```
AP  ·  select-all  ·  backspace  ·  mic  ·  book  ·  1  2  3  ·  enter
```

**The order is Marko's and it has been corrected twice.** At build 139 the switches were on the left
and the borrowed keys on the right, and he swapped them. At **build 146** he moved the microphone in
beside backspace, put the book next to it, and sent enter to the far end. Do not rearrange this row
on a theory. It is arranged by the person using it, from a screenshot with arrows drawn on it, and
both corrections went the opposite way to what seemed sensible from the code.

Three reasons hold in the current order and are worth knowing before touching it. The busy group
belongs at the end the thumb starts from. **The microphone and the book belong together**, because
they are the only two keys here that change which view is on screen, and a pair doing one kind of
thing is found by feel where two keys of the same kind at opposite ends are not. And **enter belongs
bottom right**, where every keyboard ever made has put it: borrowing a habit somebody already has
beats any argument about grouping.

- **1 is the number row** (`maExtraRow`). It was the edit strip before; that meaning moved to 3.
- **2 is the keys themselves** (`maZoneKeyboard`), all of them at once, unchanged.
- **3 is the copy and paste row** along the top (`maEditRow`).

Each key is green while its own switch is on, dark when it is off. **A key shows its switch, not
what is on screen.** Folding the keys away with 2 takes the number row with them, because the number
row sits inside that zone, but it must not erase the decision about whether the number row belongs
there when the keys come back, so 1 can be green while nothing is visible. That is the truth about
the switch and it is deliberate; do not "fix" it by tinting on visibility, because then 1 could be
pressed with no effect anywhere and a key that cannot change colour reads as broken.

**1 and 2 act on the keyboard view only**, since the transcribe view has neither a number row nor a
key grid to fold. 3 acts on both, and had to be gated in the transcribe view as well as in the
keyboard view: it is the same row from the same code, and a switch that works in one view and not
the other looks broken from whichever view it was pressed in.

**AP, select-all and backspace are drawn by `LegacyActionKey`**, the copy row's own key renderer,
which is now `internal` rather than private for exactly the reason `tapKey` was: a row in another
file could not call it. They are the same keys, not copies that look like them, so a fix to AP's
timing or to backspace's swipe reaches both rows at once.

Backspace and enter are there because they are the two keys from the keyboard proper with no
substitute anywhere else: with zone two shut there is otherwise no way to delete a character or end
a line. Enter is `LegacyEnterKey`, the bottom row's own key, so holding it still opens the character
popup from the settings screen. **These three keys do not
fold the row on a long press and must not**, because backspace holds to repeat and swipes to select,
and a key that repeats cannot also mean something else when it is held. The other five still fold it.

### Next: AssemblyAI Sync, fast dictation on one API

Decided and researched, not yet built. One provider throughout: AssemblyAI, the same key and the
same bill as now. No second vendor.

**Speechify was investigated and rejected.** It has no speech-to-text API at all; the whole product
is text to speech. Their "10 Best Speech to Text APIs" article recommends other companies and reads
like a product page, which is where the confusion came from. Speechify IS worth revisiting for the
LLL reader, because its TTS returns word-level timestamps, which is exactly what `MaAlign` needs and
would replace an undocumented Microsoft endpoint with a contractual one. **That happened at build
141; see "Speechify, the reader's voice" below.** It is still not a transcription provider and the
`tts` capability on its preset is what stops a transcription role ever being pointed at it.

**The verified endpoint**, checked against the docs rather than remembered:

```
POST https://sync.assemblyai.com/transcribe
Authorization: <raw key, no Bearer prefix>
X-AAI-Model: universal-3-5-pro
multipart/form-data, field "audio"
-> { "text": ..., "confidence": ... }
```

About 134 ms at the median. **Hard limits: 2 minutes and 40 MB per request**, and oversized requests
are rejected up front rather than failing partway. Price is $0.45/hr against $0.15/hr for the async
path in use today.

**Three things read off the OpenAPI spec at `/docs/api-reference/sync-api/transcribe`, none of them
guessable and two of them corrections to what this document said before.**

1. **It takes WAV or PCM only.** The `audio` part's content type must be `audio/wav` or
   `audio/pcm`, and there is a 415 `unsupported_media_type` for anything else. Our pipeline ends in
   AAC, so **the fast path has to send the 16 kHz WAV and skip the encode step**. Size is not the
   problem: two minutes of 16 kHz mono is about 3.8 MB against a 40 MB cap. Bytes on the wire are:
   it is roughly fifteen times what the AAC would have been, so fast is fast on a decent connection
   and is not automatically fast on a poor one. That is a second reason for the automatic fallback,
   not only the two minute limit.
2. **Croatian cannot be named.** `language_code` takes nineteen codes and `hr` is not one of them
   (en es de fr it pt tr nl sv no da fi hi vi ar he ja ur zh). It also only steers the default
   prompt, and is **ignored entirely when a custom `prompt` is set**. The documented route for a
   language outside that list is to state it inside a contextual prompt instead. Whether
   Universal-3.5 Pro actually reads Croatian well is still open and still answered by one recording.
   Note also that the async prompting guide says to keep universal-2 as a fallback for anything
   outside Universal-3 Pro's core six, and Sync has no model choice at all.
3. **There is a `GET /warm`.** Unauthenticated, idempotent, and it opens DNS, TCP and TLS ahead of
   the transcribe call so the handshake is off the critical path. It only helps if the same OkHttp
   connection pool and base URL are used, and idle connections are evicted within seconds to
   minutes, so it is called when recording starts, not at app start. This is most of what the
   median figure means in practice and belongs in step 1.

Other details worth having: the style/punctuation prompt this app sends elsewhere is the wrong thing
to send here, since `prompt` on this model is a description of what the audio *is* and formatting
instructions are documented as ignored. Errors carry a machine-readable `error_code`
(`audio_too_short`, `audio_too_large`, `capacity_exceeded`, …), the minimum length is 80 ms, and
there is a 30 s per-request deadline answered with 504.

**Why Sync rather than streaming.** A WebSocket is an open line billed by how long it is open, and it
must be held, reconnected and closed. A single request is one envelope: the clip goes up whole and
the finished text comes back in the same breath. Dictation already has a clean beginning and end
because Marko presses and releases, so there is nothing streaming buys here that is worth a socket.
AssemblyAI's own description of Sync names dictation and voice commands as its purpose.

**Build in this order. Each step is useful alone.**

1. **The Sync client and the fast/slow switch.** `TranscriptionApi.ASSEMBLYAI_SYNC` beside the
   existing `ASSEMBLYAI_ASYNC` in `ProviderConfig.kt`, dispatched in `OpenAiCompatibleClient` around
   line 161 where `ASSEMBLYAI_ASYNC` already is, and a preset in `ProviderRegistry`. Settings calls
   them **fast** and **slow**, because those are the words that mean something. Anything over two
   minutes falls back to the async path AUTOMATICALLY and silently, since a long recording is exactly
   the one that took the most effort and must never be the one that fails.
2. **Chunking with silence-aware cuts**, which makes long recordings fast as well. Cut at a silence
   near the two minute mark, never at the mark itself, or a word is sliced in half and both halves are
   misheard. **The silence detection already exists and is already tested**: `MaWaveform.silenceRuns`
   in the reader engine, pure maths on decoded PCM, 126 tests behind it, already shipping in the APK.
   The seams then need cleaning, since each chunk comes back capitalised as a fresh sentence and a
   visible scar every two minutes is not acceptable.
3. **Pipelining**, sending chunks while Marko is still speaking, so by the time he releases the key
   everything but the last chunk is already transcribed. This is the step that makes a six minute
   dictation land as fast as a twenty second one, and it is the closest thing to streaming that this
   design needs.

**Also asked for: a cost meter.** Build it locally rather than from a billing API. The app already
knows the duration of every recording it sends and which path took it, so it can keep its own ledger:
minutes and cost this week, this month and all time, per provider, against an editable rate. Works
offline, needs no extra credentials, covers every provider, and cannot silently disagree with itself.
Settings labels it something plain like "usage and cost".

**And: long press on the microphone key opens the model chooser**, so fast and slow can be swapped
without going into settings.

### Speechify, the reader's voice: shipped at build 141

**This is not a reversal of the rejection above and the two must not be confused.** Speechify has no
speech to text API and never enters the dictation path. What it does have is text to speech that
returns **character offsets** with every word, and that is the reader's whole problem solved.

`MaAlign` exists because Microsoft's endpoint returns a spoken word and a time and nothing else, so
the engine has to work out which characters of the visible sentence that word was. Every branch in
`alignTokens` is there because that guess went wrong once. Speechify's `speech_marks` carry `start`
and `end` indices into the string that was sent, alongside `start_time` and `end_time`. So the
Speechify path skips `MaAlign` **and** the waveform refinement: it is not a faster route to the same
answer, it is the answer without the question.

**Verified against the live reference, not remembered:**

```
POST https://api.speechify.ai/v1/audio/speech
Authorization: Bearer sk_...        <- Bearer, unlike AssemblyAI's raw key
Content-Type: application/json
{ "input", "voice_id", "model", "audio_format", "language" }
-> { "audio_data": <base64>, "billable_characters_count": N,
     "speech_marks": { start, end, start_time, end_time, value, chunks: [...] } }
```

2000 characters per request on this endpoint, 20000 on the streaming one which we do not use: the
reader already works one sentence at a time so neither figure is ever approached, and one envelope
beats a chunked response. Errors are one envelope with a stable `error.code`.

**CROATIAN DOES NOT WORK AND THIS IS THE THING TO KNOW.** `hr-HR` is on Speechify's *coming soon*
list, not supported and not even beta, and `simba-3.2` and `simba-english` are English only and
answer a non-English voice with a flat 400. So the reader now has **two voice engines**: Speechify
for English, Edge for Croatian, chosen in `MaReader.speak` by the prefix of the active voice string.
Do not point `MaLanguage`'s Croatian half at Speechify and hope. When `hr-HR` ships the change is one
condition and a model id, and `MaSpeechify.MODEL_MULTILINGUAL` is already named for that day.

`MaReader.speak` returns **null** rather than throwing for every reason to decline, no key, wrong
language, dead key, no signal. They all mean the same thing to the caller, which is that the Edge
path should run. A sentence must never go unspoken because the newer voice was busy.

**A trap that cost nothing only because it was caught before the push: `MaAlign.Token.d` is an END
TIME in seconds, not a duration.** `playUnit` lights a word while `t <= now < d`, and `spread` writes
`d = t + each`. The name says duration. Writing a duration there compiles, runs, and lights every
word for the wrong span, which on the phone reads as a highlight that drifts rather than as a bug.
Check `playUnit` before touching anything that builds a Token.

**Do not write a fake key beginning `sk_live_` or `sk_test_` anywhere in this repository.** Those are
Stripe's prefixes, GitHub's push protection scans every push for them, and it rejected build 141 on
its first attempt over two invented strings in a test file. Bypassing the block is one click and is
the wrong move: the rule is right and the fixture was lazy. Shape a fake Speechify key as `sk_` plus
sixteen or more characters and nothing else.

Keys: `sk_` and nothing else. OpenAI's are `sk-`. One character apart, and that character is all that
keeps a keyring holding both from filing them under each other, so `MaKeys.SPEECHIFY` exists rather
than letting them fall through to the generic tier. Twelve tests in
`lib/dictate-core/.../MaSpeechifyTest.kt` cover the parsing, the mark flattening and the ledger; they
are pure Kotlin and run in the sandbox, so this whole area is provable without CI.

### Usage and cost: shipped at build 141, and why it counts rather than asks

Under every key in the key manager there is now a line saying what that key has cost.

**Neither provider will tell us.** Speechify's public reference is three groups of endpoints, audio,
voices and models. There is no usage endpoint, no balance, no spend. `spend_cap` and
`spend_cap_remaining` are real fields but they only ever reach a webhook or the console, and a
keyboard has no webhook. AssemblyAI has no balance endpoint on the transcription API either. So the
numbers are counted here or they do not exist.

That is the better half of the trade anyway: it works with no signal, needs no second credential,
covers every provider identically and cannot disagree with itself the way two sources do. What it
cannot see is spending from the console or another device, and the screen **says so** rather than
implying a total that is not one.

**The counting is exact on the side that matters.** Speechify returns `billable_characters_count`
with every reply, so the recorded figure is the billed figure rather than a count of the string that
was sent. Transcription records milliseconds of audio, which the app already knows.

- `MaUsage` in dictate-core is the arithmetic, pure and tested, including the Sunday case in
  `startOfWeek`: Calendar numbers Sunday as 1, so the obvious subtraction is wrong one day in seven,
  which is exactly often enough never to be noticed.
- `MaUsageStore` in the app is one JSON file in `filesDir`. Deliberately not a preference: this is an
  append-only log, and a preference store would copy it whole on every write and drag it into every
  backup.
- **The ledger never holds a key**, only the last four characters, which is enough to line a row up
  with the list above it and useless to anyone reading the file.
- **Rates are not invented.** The two AssemblyAI figures are published. Speechify's per-character
  price depends on the plan and was not verified, so it is left at zero and the line reads *no rate
  set* beside the real character count. A made up price is worse than no price because it looks like
  an answer. Setting it is the next small job, along with the whole-app usage screen.

The key tester now probes Speechify by **synthesising two characters** rather than listing anything.
A key that can list voices but can no longer spend passes a listing test and then fails the moment
the reader needs it, and a green light on that key is a lie. The probe's own characters go into the
ledger: a meter that excludes its own traffic drifts.

402 means three different things on this API and they are fixed in three different places, so
`MaSpeechify.classify` keeps them apart: `spend_cap_exceeded` is this key's own monthly cap,
`spend_budget_exceeded` is the workspace budget, `payment_required` is the balance. All three are
QUOTA_EXCEEDED so the key fallback still rolls on, but the sentence under the light says which.

### The trailing space after a suggestion: shipped at build 141

Picking a word from the suggestion strip used only to **arm** the phantom space, so the gap appeared
at the moment the next word was typed and not before. Correct in the text, wrong on the screen: the
word sits against whatever follows until you have already typed past it. `commitCompletion` now
commits a real space and marks it with `autoSpace`, which is the existing mechanism that deletes such
a space again when punctuation follows, so "word" then "." is still "word." and not "word .".

The phantom space stays armed on purpose. It carries the candidate for the revert-on-backspace path
in `KeyboardManager`, and its own `determine()` cannot fire twice because the character before the
cursor is now a space, which is neither a letter, a digit, nor a member of
`symbolsPrecedingPhantomSpace`.

Not applied when `keyVariation` is anything but `NORMAL`: a space dropped into an email address or a
URL is a broken value.

This is one of the two halves of the old "trailing space" item. **The other half, the trailing space
after a recased word, is still open** and is listed below.

### Sixty keys: what broke at that number, fixed at build 142

Marko asked whether the key manager really holds fifty or more keys. It did not, quite, and the
failures only appear past about a dozen. Measured with a sixty key file, a year of ledger entries.

- **The parser was already fine**: 60 of 60 lifted out of a messy file in 53 ms, in every layout
  (bare, labelled, quoted, `KEY=`, trailing comment), no foreign keys taken, and re-importing the
  same file still changes nothing.
- **The usage lines were O(keys x entries).** `describeKey` walks the whole ledger, so sixty keys
  meant sixty walks: **161 ms on the main thread on every recomposition**, which is a stutter while
  scrolling the screen. `MaUsage.totalsByKey` and `describeAll` now bucket in one pass: **23 ms**,
  identical answers, asserted by a test so it cannot quietly come back.
- **The ledger file is read off the main thread now.** At that size it is over a megabyte and took
  223 ms to parse. It is read once, in a `LaunchedEffect` on IO, and the lines appear when they land.
- **TEST ALL fired every key at once**, which at sixty keys is the most reliable way to trip a rate
  limit. A 429 was then classified QUOTA_EXCEEDED and painted a **healthy key amber**, inviting it to
  be deleted. `MaSpeechify.probe` now backs off once on a 429 and then reports **not checked** rather
  than a verdict. A light must never say something about a key that is really about the burst it
  arrived in. **The bulk test itself is gone at build 143**, replaced by the key ring below; making
  it sequential was the right direction and not far enough.

**The lights say what happened, and there is no light for credit remaining**, because no provider
here will say. See the usage section above: the numbers are what this phone counted.

### The key ring: first working key wins, shipped at build 143

**Marko's rule, and it replaces what builds 141 and 142 did.** Go down the list in order. Take the
first key that works. Use it until it stops working. Then flag it and move to the next. **Never test
them all at once.**

`maWithKeyFallback` walks the list in order on every call, which is correct and has **no memory**: a
keyring whose first four keys are dead pays four failed round trips before every sentence the reader
speaks, forever. And the bulk test checked every key, which on a per-character bill means paying, per
key, to learn about keys that were never going to be reached. `MaKeyRing` is the memory that was
missing, and the button is now **FIND A WORKING KEY**, which stops at the first green.

**The hard part is not flagging, it is not flagging too eagerly.** The distinction is between a
failure OF the key and a failure AROUND it:

| what came back | the key's fault | what happens |
|---|---|---|
| 401 rejected | yes, permanently | flagged, never re-armed by time, only by a manual test |
| 402 cap, budget or balance | yes, temporarily | flagged, re-armed after six hours or at the UTC month roll |
| 429 too many requests | **no** | nothing recorded |
| timeout, no signal | **no** | nothing recorded, and the run stops rather than burning the ring |

Flagging a good key because the train went into a tunnel is worse than never flagging: the key is
skipped, the next one is used, and the meter fills up somewhere Marko did not choose. The middle two
rows are the ones to protect.

Three rules that are easy to break by tidying:

- **The ring can never return nothing.** If every key is flagged, `order` still returns them all,
  worst last. A stale flag must not be able to silence the reader, and a key dead in March may work
  in August. Being wrong about a key costs one failed request; refusing to try costs the feature.
- **`NoKeyLeft` carries the ring.** The run that discovers the whole keyring is in trouble is the
  most expensive one there is, and its flags are inside an exception rather than a return value.
  Dropping them means paying for the same discovery again on the very next sentence.
- **A manual test clears the flag first.** Otherwise a key just topped up in the console stays greyed
  out because of yesterday, and the only way to clear it would be to know the rule.

Six hours for the exhausted window: a spend cap is raised in the console in a minute, and a keyring
that ignores a topped-up key until tomorrow looks broken. The month roll is separate and additional,
because per-key caps and workspace budgets both reset at 00:00 UTC on the 1st.

The key manager and the reader now write to the **same** ring, so a green light in settings and the
key the reader actually reaches for are the same fact. Two stores holding two opinions is how a green
light ends up above a key nothing will ever use.

Fourteen tests in `MaKeyRingTest.kt`, all pure Kotlin and run in the sandbox. The two that matter
most are `aDeadConnectionNeverFlagsAKey` and `everyKeyFlaggedStillTriesThemAll`.

### The ring covers every provider, shipped at build 144

Build 143 put Speechify on the ring. This puts **everything** on it: transcription, the segmented
path, realtime, the sync warm-up and rewording. `MaKeyRingStore` was already keyed by provider id, so
generalising it was mostly a matter of finding the call sites, and finding them turned up a bug that
predates all of this.

**Several paths were sending the whole keyring as one credential.** `account.apiKey` holds every key
separated by newlines, and `transcribeSegmentRaw`, `requestRewordRaw`, `warmSync` and the realtime
open all passed that field straight into a client. With one key stored it worked perfectly. With two
it sent both as a single header value, and the service answered with a complaint about a line break,
which is the failure `MaKeys.tidyError` already had a friendly sentence for: *"That key contains a
line break. Re-import it from your file."* The sentence was treating a symptom. Anything reaching for
a key now goes through `MaKeyRingStore.currentKey` or `.keys` and gets one key.

- **Rewording is on the ring now too.** It used to take whatever was in the field and fail outright
  when that key was refused, which on a keyring of ten was a strange thing to do while dictation
  happily rolled to the next one.
- **`MaKeyRing.run` is `inline`**, so the block may suspend. Half the call sites are inside suspend
  functions and half are not; an inline lambda satisfies both without a second copy of the logic,
  and a second copy is exactly how the two would drift apart.
- **`MaKeyRingStore.bind` is called once from `FlorisApplication.onCreate`** with the application
  context. The ring is needed from a dozen places that were never handed a Context and have no
  business acquiring one. Every accessor tolerates nothing being bound: no memory, which degrades to
  the old walk-from-the-top rather than to a crash.
- **A key borrowed from the transcription account is flagged under the transcription account**, since
  rewording falls back to it when its own field is blank. Flagging it under rewording would put the
  verdict on a row Marko never looks at.
- **`realtimeApiForActiveAccount` still reads the raw field**, deliberately: it asks only whether any
  key exists at all, and the ring may legitimately have flagged all of them without that meaning
  realtime is unavailable.

`maWithKeyFallback` is now unused and is marked superseded rather than deleted, in case anything
outside this module still calls it.

### The strip only exists when it has something to say: shipped at build 147

Marko sent a screenshot of the keyboard with the suggestion strip holding the letters `EN` and
nothing else, across a full row, on a phone, above a keyboard that is already the bottom half of the
display. It now appears in exactly two cases: **there is a suggestion**, or **a recording is
running**. Otherwise it is not composed and reserves no height.

**The dangerous part is not the visibility, it is that two pieces of code decide this row.** The one
that draws it, and `FlorisImeSizing.smartbarRowCountAsState`, which reserves its height. This project
has already paid for those disagreeing, at build 138 on the keyboard fold: the keys stopped being
drawn while the arithmetic went on counting four rows, so the keys vanished and the space stayed.
So `maSmartbarHasContent()` is a single composable both callers read, and anything that changes when
the strip appears changes there and nowhere else.

For the same reason **there is no animation on this row.** A 200 ms fade against a height that
changes in one frame is that same disagreement in slow motion, seen as a band of nothing while the
fade finishes. It appears and disappears with its height, in the same frame.

Two traps met on the way:

- **`remember { derivedStateOf { … } }` with no keys**, which is how `smartbarRowCountAsState` was
  already written. It works there because every value read inside is a delegated `State` object read
  live. A plain `Boolean` captured the same way is frozen at first composition and the row sticks at
  whatever it was when the keyboard opened. The new key is passed as a `remember` key for exactly
  this reason; do not tidy it away.
- **No early return above a composable call** in `maSmartbarHasContent`. Every flow is read
  unconditionally before anything is decided, because an early return changes the slot count of the
  composition.
- The prompt row is deliberately **outside** this. It has its own switch and its own term in
  `panelUiHeight`, and it is a row of controls rather than a row of answers.

A consequence worth knowing rather than discovering: the language badge lives on this strip, so in
the keyboard view it is visible exactly while there are suggestions beside it, which is while typing.
That is the moment the suggestion language matters. When idle there is no badge, and the language is
still switched by volume down, or in the transcribe view.

### One language toggle, everywhere: shipped at build 147

`MaLanguage.badge()` now returns **HR** or **ENG**, and Marko asked for those two spellings by name.
`EN` and `HR` are the same shape and the same weight, so in the corner of a moving keyboard they read
as "some code" and telling them apart takes a moment of real reading. `ENG` does not look like `HR`.
Display only; the stored codes stay `en` and `hr` and nothing branches on the string.

- **The recording bar now carries the language**, inside the centred group and immediately before the
  meter. While a recording ran there was nothing on screen saying which language it would be
  transcribed as, which is the one moment the answer matters: by the time a transcript comes back in
  the wrong language the speaking is already done. It is **inside** the centred group rather than out
  at an edge, because a badge on the left pushes the stopwatch off centre by its own width and a
  nearly centred stopwatch reads as a mistake. Tappable, since it cannot be reached any other way
  mid recording: volume down means cancel while a recording runs.
- **The transcribe view's quick row is one key, not one per language.** It drew a button per enabled
  language and lit the active one, which is a radio group drawn the expensive way: it spends the
  width of every option to say what one word already says. That shape is only right while a third
  language might appear, and there are two, permanently. Auto-detect went with the languages it
  belonged to.
- **The toggle has no selected state**, deliberately. A toggle showing HR is not "HR is on", it is
  "you are in HR". Lighting it would say the first, and then the eye asks what the unlit state means
  and there is no answer.

**The bin stays.** Marko started to ask for it to be removed from the keyboard view and changed his
mind inside the same sentence. It was not touched.

### The language picker is gone, and one row carries the two decisions: build 148

Marko sent a screenshot of the Transcription languages screen listing Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic
and ninety-six others, on an app whose second rule is that it has exactly two languages, permanently.
The screen was inherited from the fork and had simply never been deleted. **It is gone, with its
route, its home entry, its two search index entries and every picker that read from it**: the
Smartbar chip, the transcribe view's cycle-and-long-press key, and the recording bar chip. All three
are now the same one tap toggle, showing HR or ENG.

`DictateLanguages.kt` itself stays. It is the code table, and `DictateController` still needs it to
name a language on the wire. What is removed is every place that offered it as a **choice**. If a
picker over that table ever reappears, that is this mistake coming back.

`prefs.dictate.inputLanguages` also stays for now, written to `hr,en` by the migrator, because
several call sites still read it. Emptying it is a separate job and a wrong move if rushed: the
active language snaps back into that selection on load, so a blank one would strand the language.

**FAST and SLOW, on the quick row, in the slot the language buttons gave back.** One saving paid
straight into the next thing worth reaching without opening settings. SLOW uploads a small compressed
file and waits for the job at a third of the price; FAST posts the audio and the transcript comes
back in the same breath. Which is worth it is a judgement made in the second before speaking, which
is why it belongs there. **FAST is a preference and never a promise**: anything past the sync
endpoint's two minute cap goes down the slow path automatically and silently, because a long
recording is the one that took the most effort and must never be the one that fails.

### What AssemblyAI will actually tell you about a key: build 148

Marko asked whether a key test could report more than "works". It can, and here is exactly how far,
checked against the live API rather than assumed. This is written down so nobody researches it again.

- **`GET /v2/transcript?limit=200` works** and is now used. It returns the transcripts made with that
  key: status, created, error. Sorted newest first, **last 90 days only**, 200 to a page. It is
  server-side, so it counts dictations made from the laptop or anywhere else, which the local ledger
  cannot see. The key row now reads e.g. *"47 transcriptions in 90 days, 2 failed, last 2026-08-09"*.
- **There is no usage or balance endpoint.** `/v2/usage`, `/v2/billing` and `/v2/account/usage` are
  all 404, probed directly. **`/v2/account` answers `200 {}` to an invalid key**, so it returns an
  empty object to anybody; a secret-scanning vendor's page describes it as returning "usage limits
  and remaining credits" and that is wrong. Do not build on it.
- **The list carries no `audio_duration`.** That lives on the individual transcript, so minutes would
  cost one request per transcript: two hundred round trips to total one page, on a phone, on a
  settings screen. Not done.

So the split is: **the service says how many and when, the ledger says how long and what it cost.**
Neither is guessed and neither pretends to be the other. `MaAssemblyStats.history` returns null on
any failure rather than throwing, because it decorates a key that has already passed its real test
and a working key must never be reported as broken because the decoration did not arrive.

### Next: the volume key opens the drawer before it records

**Asked for at build 148, not yet built.** Volume up currently starts a recording immediately. The
new workflow is two presses:

1. **First press opens the drawer**: the dictation bar appears in the keyboard view, showing the
   language toggle and FAST/SLOW, and records nothing. Marko checks the two settings.
2. **Second press starts recording.**

This lands on top of two things that already exist, which is why it is worth doing now rather than
earlier. The strip is already dynamic (build 147) and already knows how to appear and reserve its
height in the same frame, so the drawer is that mechanism with a third reason to open. And both
controls the drawer must show already exist as one-tap toggles (build 148).

Things to settle while building it, none of them guessable:

- **What closes the drawer if the second press never comes.** A drawer that opens on a stray press
  and stays forever is the always-on row that was just removed. A timeout is the obvious answer and
  the length matters: too short and it closes while Marko is deciding.
- **Volume down.** It currently cancels while recording and switches language when idle. With an
  armed-but-not-recording state there is a third case, and the natural meaning is close the drawer.
- **The armed state has to look different from recording**, or the first press will read as a failed
  recording. Colour is reserved for state in this app, which is exactly what this is: gold armed,
  red recording, and those two are already the established pair on the keyboard's own modifier keys.

### The drawer: volume up opens, volume up again starts. Shipped at build 150

Volume up used to start recording on the first press. It now takes two: the first **opens the
drawer**, the second **starts**. The gap between them is the point. The drawer holds the language and
FAST or SLOW, and those two are the only settings in the app that cannot be corrected afterwards: a
recording made in the wrong language is not a setting to fix, it is a thing to say again.

The strip it opens is the one that became dynamic at build 147. That work is what makes this possible
at all: there is now a row that exists only when it has something to say, so opening it costs nothing
when it is shut.

**Armed is a flag, not a fifth `UiState`, and this is the decision to preserve.** Every `is
UiState.Idle` check in the app and the interface means "nothing is happening", and armed **is**
nothing happening: no recorder is open, no audio exists, nothing needs cancelling. A fifth state
would have made every one of those checks silently wrong in a way the compiler could not catch. What
armed changes is only which strip is drawn and what the next press means. For the same reason
`MaArmedSmartbarUi` is a sibling of `DictateSmartbarUi` rather than a branch inside it: that one
switches on the state, and this is not one.

The full mapping, which is now symmetric and is the reason it can be used without looking:

| | volume up | volume down |
|---|---|---|
| idle, shut | open the drawer | switch language |
| idle, drawer open | start recording | close the drawer |
| recording | send | throw it away |

Down always means the smaller state. Up always means the next step.

- **No timeout, deliberately.** A drawer that closes itself while being read is a drawer that has to
  be opened twice, and the press before the press is the entire feature.
- **It never survives the keyboard closing** (`onWindowHidden`), or the next unrelated volume up
  would start recording where the user expected it to open something.
- **The on-screen microphone does not gain the extra press.** A thumb already on that key can see the
  strip it is about to change, so the extra press buys nothing and costs a tap on the commonest path.
- **The candidates branch and the language badge both stand down while armed.** The strip's branches
  are siblings in a `Box`, not arms of a `when`, so anything not explicitly stood down draws
  underneath. Two language toggles side by side would also be two answers to one question.
- FAST in the drawer and FAST in the transcribe row are the same preference read twice. Neither keeps
  a copy, so they cannot disagree.

### The utility row, and AUTO. Shipped at build 151

The armed strip drew `ENG SLOW speak` as plain text. Marko circled all three in red. Three changes:

- **They are keys now**, using the same `ThemedKey` the feature row uses. Drawn as labels they looked
  like a readout, which is exactly wrong for three things whose entire purpose is being pressed.
- **`speak` is gone.** A word that only explains the other words is read once and then occupies the
  row forever.
- **A third key, AUTO or MANUAL.** MANUAL is the two-press form from build 150. AUTO gives the single
  press back: volume up records at once, no row first.

**Each key names what it IS, not what pressing it would do.** It says `SLOW` while the slow path is
in use. The other convention, where a button advertises what it will switch you to, is the one that
makes people press twice to find out which way round it is. State first: the tap is discoverable, the
state is not. No lit styling, because there is no off; `HR` is not "Croatian is enabled", it is "you
are in Croatian".

**THE THREE KEYS STAY ON SCREEN WHILE RECORDING, AND THIS IS WHAT MAKES AUTO SAFE.** Marko asked for
one row rather than a screen to change to, and the reason is sharper than tidiness: AUTO removes the
armed strip entirely. If the keys lived only there, turning AUTO on would hide the only way to turn
it off and the way back would be a settings screen. On the recording strip, a recording that started
before he was ready is cancelled with the button beside them and MANUAL is already under his thumb.

They appear only in `Recording`, not in the other states. Transcribing is the strip reporting rather
than offering, and a request in flight cannot be made faster or moved to another language by pressing
anything.

`MaRecordingLanguage`, the text badge added at build 147, was deleted: the `ENG` key replaced it and
two implementations of one idea is how they drift.

The full key map is now three rows deep and still symmetric. Up is the next step, down is the smaller
state. In AUTO the first row of that table simply does not happen.

### The feature row editor: shipped at build 151

Settings, Mantra, **Feature row**. The nine keys in a list with their own icons, held and dragged into
any order. The row reads the result immediately.

The argument for it is in this document twice already: the order was corrected by hand at build 139
and again at build 146, both times from a screenshot with arrows drawn on it, and **both times in the
direction opposite to what looked sensible from inside the code**. The person holding the keyboard
should not have to send a picture and wait for a build to move a key.

**Order only. Nothing can be hidden, and this is a safety rule rather than a missing feature.** This
row is the one that survives when every other row is folded away, so it is the only route to
backspace, to enter and to the microphone. An editor that could hide those could leave somebody with
a keyboard that cannot delete a character or end a line and no way back except the settings app.
Rearranging cannot lock anyone out of anything. Hiding could. If a "hide" column is ever added, `MIC`,
`BACKSPACE` and `ENTER` must be exempt from it.

- `MaFeatureOrder.parse` **always returns all nine**, whatever is stored. Unknown ids drop, duplicates
  collapse, and anything missing is appended in default order. That last part is what makes a tenth
  key safe to add later: it appears at the end for people who already customised the row, instead of
  being invisible to exactly them. Nine tests hammer this with truncated, garbled and duplicated
  input, because the failure mode is a keyboard with no enter key.
- The order is stored as **ids**, not indices, so it survives a key being added or renamed.
- **The drag is written by hand, not pulled from a library.** Nine items of one fixed height is the
  case where a reorderable list is a division: target index is drag distance over row height. The
  fixed `ROW_HEIGHT` is what buys that, so if these rows ever gain different heights the calculation
  has to be replaced rather than adjusted.
- `dragOffset` is rebased by `(target - from) * rowHeight` at the moment of a swap. Without it the
  dragged row jumps a full height exactly when it changes places.
- Rounding, not truncating, so the swap happens when the row is more than **half** over its neighbour
  rather than a full row later.
- A cancelled drag **keeps** the order it reached. The rows have already moved on screen and snapping
  them back reads as the app undoing something the user watched happen.

**`Icons.Default.KeyboardReturn` does not exist; it is `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.KeyboardReturn`.**
Caught before pushing by grepping the repo for each icon rather than trusting memory: six of the seven
had proven imports elsewhere and that one had none, which is the signal. `ComputingEvaluator` already
spells it correctly.

**The app module tests with Kotest `FunSpec`, not `kotlin.test`.** `lib/dictate-core` uses
`kotlin.test`. Writing an app-module test in the dictate-core style puts it on a classpath that may
not carry it. Match the module, not the last file you wrote.

### One press again, and the reason the drawer was never needed: build 154

Marko asked whether fast and slow can be chosen **during** a recording, since only the sending
differs. He is right, and the code says so plainly enough that I should have checked before building
the two-press drawer at build 150 rather than after.

**Both settings are read when the request is built, not when recording starts.** The pipeline is:
capture at whatever rate the phone gives, resample to 16 kHz mono WAV, and only **then** decide. The
comment at that decision has been there all along: fast or slow is chosen there *because by then the
length and the size are facts about a file instead of intentions*. `maUseSyncPath` reads the speed at
that moment and the language is read in the same place. FAST sends that WAV as-is, because Sync
accepts WAV and PCM and nothing else; SLOW encodes it to AAC first and waits for the job.

So either can be changed at any point up to release, and cancel is available throughout. The second
press was charging a tap on the commonest action in the app to prevent a mistake that is already
correctable while still speaking. Removed, with `maArmed`, `maArm`, `maDisarm`, the armed strip and
the `maAutoRecord` preference that had grown alongside it.

**Anything that wants to arm before recording again must be checked against those two reads first.**
Both are late on purpose.

The two keys survive on the recording strip, which is where they were always doing the real work:
`ENG`/`HR` and `FAST`/`SLOW`, changeable mid sentence.

- **The sync warm-up is gone.** It was a bare `GET /warm` fired when a recording started. Worth being
  straight about: it was **not** billing anything, since AssemblyAI charges on audio duration and
  that request carried none. But it bought only a TLS handshake, and Marko would rather have no
  request at all until he has finished speaking. `warmSync()` is deleted from `OpenAiCompatibleClient`
  too rather than left as an unused entry point.
- **Two-minute stitching is dropped from the plan, on Marko's instruction.** Over two minutes falls
  back to the slow path, which is what already happens and what the fallback was designed to do. It
  is no longer an open item.

### The recording lamp: build 154

A red dot before the stopwatch, in `MaRecordMeter`, so both views get it from one change.

A red circle has meant recording on every camera and tape machine for fifty years; a number counting
up only means recording once it has been read. It obeys the colour rule rather than bending it, since
colour in this app means state and this is the state itself, in the app's own recording red.

**It does not pulse.** Nothing in this app breathes, and a blinking light on a strip that already has
a moving meter and a running clock would be a third thing competing for the eye. It goes dark while
paused, which is the one thing a steady lamp has to get right or it lies for as long as the pause
lasts. The signal is `recording?.paused`, not the meter's own `active` flag, which also covers being
frozen for a discard.

### Reading a screenshot: build 155

A camera key in the LLL reader, beside paste. It takes the **newest file in the screenshots folder**,
sends it to Groq's vision model, and loads the words into the reader, which starts speaking them.

**Why the newest file rather than capturing the screen.** A keyboard cannot screenshot anything.
Android offers `MediaProjection`, which shows a consent dialog per session and needs a foreground
service and a trampoline activity, or an `AccessibilityService`, which is permission to read
everything on screen forever. Marko's own suggestion avoids both: he presses power and volume down, a
gesture already in his thumbs, and the app reads what that produced. One ordinary media permission,
granted once, and it keeps him in control of what gets sent.

**THE PROMPT IS THE FEATURE.** A phone screenshot is mostly not the thing being read. His own example
had a status bar above and a third of the screen taken by this very keyboard, and a model told only
"read this image" returns `12:01`, `4G+`, `71`, `ENG FAST ab AB Ab`, `AP 1 2 3` woven into the
sentences. Read aloud that is unusable. `MaVision.OCR_PROMPT` therefore spends most of its words on
what NOT to return, ordered from the most common intrusion down, and a test asserts the exclusions
are still in it so they cannot drift out.

Two clauses look like fussiness and are not. **No preamble**, because every instruction-tuned model
opens with "Here is the text from the image:" and that sentence then gets spoken every single time.
**Nothing when there is nothing**, because a model asked for text in a picture with no prose invents a
description of the picture instead, and a description is exactly what this is not for.

`extractText` strips the preamble as well, but **only when the first line is short and ends in a
colon**. A naive "drop the first line" eats the opening sentence of an article, which is the case the
tests pin down.

- **Groq was in the registry but not in `presets`**, so `byId("groq")` returned null and
  `MaKeyImport` silently dropped every Groq key in the keyring file. Listing it is what gives it the
  key manager, the multi-key ring, the tester and the parser, all at once. Its keys are `gsk_`, which
  now has its own shape so it cannot be filed elsewhere.
- **Downscaling is not an optimisation.** These models bill by image tiles, and a 1080×2400 screenshot
  costs several times more tokens than the text needs. The long edge goes to 1568 via `inSampleSize`
  during decode, so the full-size bitmap never exists in memory, which matters in a keyboard process.
- **`DATE_ADDED` is in SECONDS.** Reading it as milliseconds puts every screenshot in 1970 and makes
  the staleness warning fire on all of them.
- The folder is found by **bucket name** first and path second, because `Pictures/Screenshots`,
  `DCIM/Screenshots` and vendor variants all disagree, and bucket name is what they agree on.
- The permission differs by version: `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` from 33, `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` below.
  Asking for the wrong one is a permission the system silently never grants, which looks exactly like
  a missing screenshot.

### Settings opens on Mantra: build 155

`HomeScreen`'s tab was `rememberSaveable`, so one visit to the FlorisBoard tab made every later visit
open there. Right for a scroll position, wrong here: FlorisBoard is what survived the fork and is
visited once to check something, Mantra is the app. Plain `remember` now, so settings always lands on
his side.

### The settings list becomes Marko's: build 156

The Mantra tab is now a **flat, user-ordered list**, edited in Settings, Mantra, Edit settings order,
with the same hold-and-drag as the feature row.

**The group headings went with the grouping, and that is the real change.** "Start here",
"Dictation", "Saved", "Keyboard extras" were a filing system, and a filing system contradicts a free
order: the moment History can sit above Recording, a heading saying *Saved* is either a lie or a
cage. Flat is the honest version and on a phone it is also two screens shorter.

The default order is Marko's instruction read literally, custom things first: Little man, Feature
row, Opening view, Macro bar, db, API keys, then the dictation settings in the order a dictation
happens in, then the two archives, then the editor for this list last. `SETTINGS_ORDER` is **in** the
list rather than pinned outside it, because it is a link like any other and someone who wants it at
the top should be able to drag it there.

- **The drag is now shared.** `MaReorderableColumn` was extracted from the feature row editor when
  this needed exactly the same thing. Two copies of drag arithmetic is how two lists quietly stop
  behaving alike, one swapping where the other shifts, and nobody able to say why.
- **`MaSettingsEntry.route` is an extension, not a field.** The enum lives in the settings package
  and `Routes` knows every screen in the app; putting a route on the enum would drag the whole
  navigation graph into a file whose only job is names and an order.
- `parse` always returns every entry, so a settings screen added later appears at the bottom for
  people who have already arranged the list rather than being invisible to exactly them.
- **`Icons.Default.Reorder` has no proven import in this repo**, so `Tune` is used instead. Same
  check that caught `KeyboardReturn` at build 151: grep the repo for each icon, and treat zero
  existing usages as the signal.

### Removed at build 156

- **"Try the keyboard" and `TryItScreen`, entirely.** Setup's finish button used to land there; it
  now lands on the settings list. A page whose only purpose was to be typed into was a stop on the
  way to somewhere, and the keyboard is reachable from any text field on the phone.
- **The "Try out your setup" preview bar, entirely**, including the `previewFieldVisible` property on
  `FlorisScreen` and its 33 assignments across the settings screens. `PreviewKeyboardField` itself
  survives because `ThemeEditorScreen` builds its own; what is gone is the app-wide bar.

### Opening view: build 156

Settings, Mantra, Opening view. **Defaults to the typing keyboard**, replacing a rule that always
reopened whichever view was last used. That rule existed to stop a view being lost and it does, but
it also makes the keyboard that appears depend on something done in another app an hour ago, and a
text field that greets you with a live microphone is a surprise every time it happens.

`last` is still offered, so this is a setting rather than a deletion. The reader is deliberately not
an option: it is entered to read something specific, and a keyboard that opens into it is a keyboard
that cannot type. An unreadable preference falls to the keyboard, never to dictation: one is a
surprise, the other is a live microphone.

### Three feature row fixes, all reported by Marko: build 159

**The drag only ever moved one place, then died.** `MaReorderableColumn` keyed its `pointerInput` on
`(index, items)`, so the moment the order changed the input restarted, and restarting a `pointerInput`
**cancels the gesture running inside it**. The first swap killed its own drag, every time. The list is
read through `rememberUpdatedState` now and the key is `index` alone. Never put a changing collection
in a `pointerInput` key.

**The AP icon did not match the keyboard.** AP is drawn on the row as the two letters `AP`, and the
comment at the key says why: every clipboard glyph already means one of the four keys beside it. The
editor invented a `ContentPaste` icon, so it showed something that appears nowhere on the keyboard.
The editor must show the key, not an idea of the key.

**Keys can now be switched off**, with a checkbox each. `MIC`, `BACKSPACE` and `ENTER` cannot, and the
exemption is enforced in `parseHidden` and `visible` rather than only in the editor: a preference
edited by hand or restored from an old backup must still not be able to produce a keyboard that
cannot delete a character, end a line, or reach the dictation view. The locked rows show a tick that
does not respond rather than no tick, because an empty space invites the question and a fixed tick
answers it.

**A Kotlin object initialises its properties top to bottom.** `DEFAULT_HIDDEN_RAW` calls
`serializeHidden`, which reads `ALWAYS_ON`; with `ALWAYS_ON` declared below it, it is still null at
that moment and the first touch of `MaFeatureOrder` throws. Nothing warns about this. `ALWAYS_ON` is
declared first on purpose and there is a comment saying so.

### Little Man AI Assistant: renamed, and on the row. Build 159

Renamed everywhere it is shown. He also has a key on the feature row now, wearing
`RecordVoiceOver`, the same icon his settings entry uses, so the row and the settings list name him
the same way.

**He ships switched OFF**, listed in `DEFAULT` and hidden in `DEFAULT_HIDDEN`. That pair is the
pattern for every key added later: it appears in the editor at once and on the keyboard only when
asked for. A row that grows a key on its own is a row whose other keys all moved, and every one of
those positions is something a thumb had learned.

**Still to build, and it is the larger half:** his own bar in the keyboard view stripped to a single
button, the voice-prompt history box beside him with summary above and prompt below, long press to
open an editor, and the model picker in his settings.

### The Little Man and his train: build 160

Marko's picture and it is the right one. The assistant is the **locomotive**, fixed at the head of the
row, and every instruction ever spoken to him is a **wagon** behind it. The wagons scroll
horizontally; the locomotive never does, because it is the button that starts a new instruction and a
head that can be scrolled off is a head lost behind its own wagons.

**His old bar is gone entirely.** It held a chip per saved prompt with the live-prompt button among
them: two kinds of button on one strip, one meaning "run this saved thing" and the other "run this
thing I said". That is a row which has to be read to be used. There is one Little Man now, and
everything else on the row is history.

Each wagon carries the **summary above and the prompt below**, which is the only arrangement that
works at that size: the summary is what the eye lands on, the prompt underneath confirms it is the
right one. Fixed width, because carriages of varying width give the eye nothing to count along.

- **Tap runs it. Long press opens the editor.** The editor exists for a narrow and real reason: these
  instructions arrived by voice, voice gets one word wrong, and re-speaking a whole sentence to fix a
  word is exactly what it saves.
- **An edited wagon keeps its place in the line**, which is why `MaLittleMan.edited` exists rather
  than a remove followed by a `remember`. `remember` moves an instruction to the front, which is
  right when it is *used* and wrong when it is *corrected*. Editing is not using.
- **The summary is computed locally, never asked of the model.** A summary from the assistant would
  cost a request, a wait and money per prompt, to label something Marko said himself and will
  recognise from its own first words. Leading filler is stripped first, or six wagons all read
  "Can you" and the list has to be read rather than scanned.
- **He has no model of his own.** The row in his settings shows and sets the *same* preference the
  rewording screen uses, because everything he does goes through the rewording path. A second setting
  would be a second answer to one question and the two would disagree the first time either moved.

`MaLivePrompts` gained `replaceAll`, since editing must write the whole line back in order and every
other path there either prepends or removes.

`DictatePromptRow` is now a one-line delegate to `MaLittleManTrain`. Its `prompts` and `rows`
parameters are unused and kept only so the two call sites and the height arithmetic in
`FlorisImeSizing` did not have to change in the same push; the next person here can drop them.

### Next: retranscribe

Robust sending is done. What remains of that item is the manual half: a circular back-arrow, in
**both** views, whenever a recording was interrupted or failed, so the kept audio can be resent
deliberately. The resend path already exists in the error handling (`ErrorAction.RESEND`, retained
audio); it is simply not surfaced as a key. This is the last item where a failure costs Marko words
rather than convenience.

### Snippets

A snippet is a **pinned clipboard item**, not a third kind of thing. Hold the clipboard key in the
copy row to save the selection (or the current clip); tap it to open the panel, where pinned items
sit at the top. `ClipboardManager.saveSnippet` inserts then looks the item back up before pinning,
because insertion is what assigns the id. Do not build a separate snippet store: it would mean a
second list, a second screen and a second place to look, for something the clipboard already does.

### The reader view (LLL), the next real project

**Decided: one app, not two.** The reader is a **third view inside TTT**, beside the keyboard view
and the transcribe view. Marko first asked for a separate sister APK that flips across with a two
finger gesture. That cannot work: Android allows one active input method at a time and an IME cannot
hand over to another without sending the user through the system input-method picker, so every flip
would open a grey system dialog. As one app the flip is instant, there is no second install, and the
clipboard is already shared because it is the same process. He agreed to this.

**What it is: a window onto the clipboard that reads.** Not a text editor, not a box to paste into.
It shows what was last copied and speaks it in a Microsoft Edge neural voice, highlighting each word
as it goes, and it lists the clipboard history so anything copied earlier can be read again. That is
the whole product. Marko's words: *a window to the clipboard which reads*.

Framing it this way settles more than it looks:

- **No text input of its own.** Nothing to type into, nothing to paste into, no keyboard needed
  inside it. Text arrives by being copied anywhere on the phone, which is a thing the user already
  does constantly and needs no instruction.
- **No dependency on a focused text field.** The reader does not touch the `InputConnection` at all,
  so it works with nothing focused, over any app, on a page that has no editable field. This is a
  large simplification: everything else in this keyboard is built around an editor being present.
- **It reads TTT's own clipboard history, not the system clipboard.** Android 10 and later only let
  the foreground app or the active IME read the system clipboard, and TTT already keeps its own
  history database with pinning. Reading from that store sidesteps the restriction entirely and gets
  snippets for free: a pinned snippet is a thing kept to be read again.
- **Snippets and the reader are the same feature seen twice.** Hold the clipboard key to save
  something worth keeping; open the reader to hear it. Do not build a second store for reading
  material.

It occupies exactly the keyboard's footprint and uses the same scheme: near-black surfaces, gold ink,
no decoration. Marko is dyslexic and the word highlight is the point of the whole thing, not a
flourish.

**The name is the brief.** LLL is Look, Listen, Learn, and Marko says every app he builds has the
property of teaching something. The pairing of a lit word and a spoken word is the teaching
mechanism, so anything that weakens it (a highlight that lags, a sweep that collapses onto one word,
a sentence that scrolls away before it is finished) is not a cosmetic bug. It is the product
failing.

**Voices: four, no more.** From the reference implementation:

| | female | male |
|---|---|---|
| English (UK) | `en-GB-SoniaNeural` | `en-GB-RyanNeural` |
| Croatian | `hr-HR-GabrijelaNeural` | `hr-HR-SreckoNeural` |

Same two languages as the keyboard, so `MaLanguage` should pick the pair and the reader only chooses
male or female within it.

#### The reference implementation

`reference/26sh_i_ma_reader_v26_macos.sh` in this repo is Marko's MA Reader v26: a single-file
macOS installer with a Flask server and the whole reader embedded. It is a year of work and it is
the specification. **Read it before writing anything.** The parts that matter:

- `synth_unit` around line 1365: the edge-tts call. Thirty lines, and the least valuable part.
- `_communicate` around line 1351: edge-tts 7.x changed the default boundary from `WordBoundary` to
  `SentenceBoundary`, which silently produced no word events at all and dropped the app onto its
  fallback. Whatever we build must ask for word boundaries explicitly.
- `align_tokens` around line 828: **the valuable part.** Maps engine word boundaries onto exact
  character ranges in the visible text, resyncing when the voice expands a number or spells an
  acronym, and interpolating by word width where matching fails so the highlight always travels left
  to right and never collapses onto the last word.
- `refine_tokens` / `measure_silence`: pins each onset to the real waveform after synthesis.

`align_tokens` and `refine_tokens` are pure logic with nothing Python-specific in them and port to
Kotlin almost line for line. Port them faithfully rather than reinventing; every branch in there
exists because something went wrong once.

#### The one hard technical fact

**edge-tts cannot be used on Android.** It is a Python library and Python does not run in an IME.
But it is only a *client*: it opens a WebSocket to Microsoft's speech endpoint, sends SSML, and reads
back binary audio frames interleaved with `WordBoundary` JSON text frames. That protocol is
reimplementable in Kotlin, and this project already ships OkHttp with a WebSocket client in use at
`lib/dictate-core/.../RealtimeClient.kt`, which is the pattern to follow.

Do not reach for Chaquopy to run Python on device: tens of megabytes for a library we would use
thirty lines of, in a process the system kills routinely.

Android's own `TextToSpeech` with `onRangeStart` is the fallback if the Edge protocol proves
unworkable. It is offline and simpler, but the voices are worse and Croatian is often not installed
at all, which would break half the point.

#### The engine lives in its own repository, and there are no copies

The Edge speech client and the word timing alignment are needed by LLL **and** by the standalone
**MA Reader Android** port. They live in **`markoboskoauroville/MA_READER_ENGINE`** and nowhere else.

This document previously described a `shared/reader/` folder here plus a rule for keeping copies in
step. That is gone and must not come back. Marko rejected it and he was right: two copies with a
synchronisation rule are still two copies, and a rule that depends on being remembered is one that
eventually is not. The failure is quiet, a fix reaching one app and not the other, and the symptom is
a highlight that stops sitting on the word being spoken.

Consume it as a **git submodule included as a Gradle module**, not as a published artifact.
Publishing means pinning a version, and pinning means the two apps can be on different versions,
which is the thing the repository exists to prevent.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/markoboskoauroville/MA_READER_ENGINE.git engine-repo
```

`settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
include(":engine")
project(":engine").projectDir = file("engine-repo/engine")
```

**CI must check out submodules** or the build fails on a missing module, which is a confusing error
for the cause:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    submodules: recursive
```

A submodule points at a commit, so a change in the engine does not arrive here until this repository
is told to move: `git submodule update --remote engine-repo`, then commit the new pointer. That is
deliberate. A change can never break both apps at once without somebody choosing it.

Marko's rule applies at that level: when the two apps sit on different engine commits, compare the
dates and move the older one up. There is only ever one version of the code, so this is a question of
when a change is picked up, never of which version is correct.

Nothing that knows about a keyboard, an `ImeUiMode` or a Compose theme goes in the engine. The test:
both apps must need it, and it must not care which is calling.

#### Build order

1. ~~**The Kotlin voice client.**~~ **Done**, in the engine repository, see below.
2. **The alignment port.** `align_tokens` and `refine_tokens` in Kotlin, tested against the same
   sentences the Python handles. This is where the quality lives.
3. **The reader view.** Third `ImeUiMode`, keyboard footprint, gold on near-black, the word
   highlight, play and pause, the latest clip shown on entry and the history reachable. Reached by
   the three way view swap key, not a gesture.

#### Step 1, the voice client: done, and living in the engine repository

`MaEdgeVoice` is in **`markoboskoauroville/MA_READER_ENGINE`**, package
`dev.mantraproductions.reader.engine`. Text and a voice in, mp3 bytes and word boundaries out. It is
**not** in this repository and must not be copied here.

It was written into `lib/dictate-core` first, before the engine repository existed, and moved. If
anything that looks like a reader engine ever turns up under `lib/` again, that is the mistake
repeating, not a second implementation.

Read that repository's README before touching the speech protocol. The short version, because it is
the part that fails silently and none of it is guessable: the accepted Chromium version in
`Sec-MS-GEC-Version` moves and a stale one is a flat 403, word boundaries have to be asked for
explicitly or no word events arrive at all, and OkHttp writes `Sec-WebSocket-Version` itself so
setting it again is answered with HTTP 400. A wrong clock reads as forbidden and is handled by
reading the server's own `Date` header and retrying once.

**Proven against the live service before it was pushed**, not left for CI to discover. Croatian,
`hr-HR-GabrijelaNeural`:

```
Danas je 8. mjesec i imam 25 godina.
26064 bytes of real mp3 frames, 4.344 s, 6 boundaries
   0.100 +0.475  Danas
   0.575 +0.088  je
   0.663 +0.825  8. mjesec
   1.488 +0.188  i
   1.675 +0.463  imam
   2.138 +1.350  25 godina
```

**Six boundaries for eight visible words, and that is the brief for step 2.** The engine answered
`8. mjesec` and `25 godina` as single boundaries covering two visible words each, so boundary text
cannot be matched to visible text one to one. That is exactly the mess `align_tokens` absorbs. Do
not simplify it when porting, and test the port against that sentence.

That repository has its own CI job which speaks for real on every push and once a night. If the
reader ever goes quiet, look there before looking here: the failure is far more likely to be
Microsoft moving than anything in this app.

**The submodule is deliberately not wired in yet.** Nothing in the keyboard calls the engine until
step 3, and a submodule that nothing uses can only break the APK build, which is what everything
else here depends on. Wire it when the reader view needs it, following the instructions above, and
remember `submodules: recursive` in CI at the same time.

**Where the sandbox got the proof from.** There is no Kotlin compiler in it by default, but the JVM
is there and the network is open, so `kotlin-compiler-2.3.20.zip` plus OkHttp, Kotest and the
serialization jars from Maven Central are enough to compile *and run* anything with no Android
imports. That is what turns "expect roughly one CI failure per non-trivial change" into none. Keep
engine code free of Android APIs and it stays provable this way.

#### Switching views: a button, and the existing flip is not to be touched

**Decided, and this corrects an earlier plan in this document.** The view swap key must stay a **two
way flip** between the typing view and the transcribe view. Marko uses that pair constantly and likes
it exactly as it is. A three way cycle was proposed here and he rejected it: it would make the pair
he uses every minute cost two presses instead of one, to save a press on the view he uses least.

The reader is reached by **its own button, placed in the transcribe view**. The common path stays one
press, the third view is one press away when it is wanted, and whoever never opens the reader never
pays for it.

A gesture was also considered and rejected: pressing a button is easier than making a gesture, and a
gesture that must never fire accidentally is awkward on purpose.

Holding the view swap key opens db and must keep doing so.

#### The reading pane behaves like a teleprompter

The currently spoken **sentence** stays in the vertical centre of the display and the text feeds
through it. The word highlight moves within that sentence. Two scales at once: sentences centred,
words lit.

This lines up with how the reference implementation already works, which is worth noticing rather
than rediscovering: it splits the passage into sentences and synthesises each sentence into its own
mp3 with its own word timings. One sentence is therefore the natural unit for the audio, the cache
and the scroll, and all three stay in step for free.

#### Fullscreen, and the honest constraint

Next to play there is a fullscreen button, and pressing it should give an immersive dark reader: text
highlighting itself and nothing else on screen. Marko's phrase is *ebook reader*.

**The constraint to face before building it.** An input method's window sits at the bottom of the
screen with the host app above it. It can be made very tall, but it is still a keyboard window: it
cannot own the screen, and it disappears the moment the keyboard closes.

Two ways to do it, and the second is probably right:

1. Grow the input view until it nearly fills the screen. Cheap, one process, but the host app is
   still visible above it and the reading still dies when the keyboard closes.
2. **Launch a real Activity.** True fullscreen, survives the keyboard closing, can keep playing while
   another app is used, and takes a back press to return. It also answers the open question below
   about audio outliving the keyboard, and it is the honest answer to *ebook reader* rather than an
   approximation of one.

The Activity is more work and gives the reader a second place to live, so the reading state must
belong to one object that both the view and the Activity read from, never be duplicated.

#### Storage: a day cache

**Decided.** Synthesised mp3s are kept for the day and are gone the next. Keyed by the text and the
voice, so re-reading the same passage today costs nothing and reading it tomorrow simply synthesises
again.

This is the right shape because it needs no management: no size limit to tune, no cleanup screen, no
files to prune, nothing accumulating unnoticed. Wipe on the first use of a new day rather than on a
timer, so a phone left alone for a week does not carry a week of audio.

The day cache and the per sentence synthesis fit together: the unit cached is one sentence, so a long
article stopped halfway resumes without re-synthesising what was already heard.

#### The relationship with the clipboard panel, worth understanding before building

The clipboard panel (`IME_UI_MODE_CLIPBOARD`, the first key in the copy row) already shows the
history as a grid, with pinned items first. The reader shows the same history and adds a reading
pane and a voice. They are close enough that building the reader carelessly produces two lists of
the same things.

The distinction to hold: the **panel is for putting text back into a field**, the **reader is for
taking text off the screen and into the ear**. Same store, opposite directions. If the reader ends up
needing a list, it should look like the panel's list, not a second design.

#### Open questions, do not guess

- **Does it speak the moment the view opens, or show the text and wait for a press?** Marko leaned
  towards automatic and then said he was not sure, so this is genuinely undecided. Note the risk
  before deciding: a keyboard that starts talking out loud the instant it is opened, in a bus or an
  edit suite, is a keyboard that gets switched off. A large obvious play control with the text
  already shown is the safer default and costs one press.
- **What happens at the end of a passage:** stop and stay, or return to the previous view.
- **Whether reading survives the keyboard closing.** Largely answered by the fullscreen Activity
  above: inside an Activity it survives naturally. Still open for the non-fullscreen case, where
  closing the keyboard should probably just stop the audio rather than leave a voice talking from an
  invisible window.

### Smaller items, any order

- The trailing space after a recased word. The suggestion half of this shipped at build 141, see
  above; the recasing pipeline is a separate path and still does not add one.
- Theme manager: watch the Downloads folder and import a `.flex` automatically
- The Auroville theme pack lags the app: locked modifiers show green only on Sunrise, because the
  green lives in the bundled stylesheet. The external repo needs the same rules.
- The symbols view is asymmetric: `ABC` sits far left while `?123` sits by the space bar. Two lines.
  **Asked three times, never answered. Do not guess.**

### Watch, do not act yet

The n-gram model shipped at build 104 and has predicted nothing on a real phone. Croatian case
endings are its known weakness: kuću, kući and kuća are three strings to a counter. Fixing that needs
a morphology table, and a wrong table merges words that are genuinely different. Thin counts recover
with use; wrong merges do not. Wait for Marko to say how it actually behaves.

### Parked, explicitly

- **The beehive hexagonal layout.** Parked until Marko reactivates it. Do not start it.

## 6. How Marko works

He dictates most of his messages, so transcription artefacts appear in them; read for intent. He
sends annotated screenshots and they are usually the fastest route to the real problem — look at them
closely before reasoning from the text alone.

He is a filmmaker and painter, and judges the app visually. "It's screaming at me" is a real bug
report about contrast. He would rather have one thing done properly than four half-done, and he says
so.

He corrects course often and his corrections are usually right. When he says a thing was
misunderstood, it usually was. Build what he describes rather than what seems more sensible, and if
something genuinely will not work, say why plainly instead of quietly building something else.

Tell him what was *not* done and why. A short honest list of what remains is worth more than an
optimistic summary.
