# Defaults to ship — note for the next build

Not code. A record of what Marko has actually arrived at on his own phone, so the next fresh
install starts there instead of at whatever was guessed. Everything below is read off his
screenshots of build 85, not proposed.

## Paste timing

He has tuned these by hand against real fields and settled on:

| Step | Value |
|---|---|
| 1. Before select all | **0** |
| 2. Before delete | **500** |
| 3. Before paste | **0** |

Currently all three default to 200. His answer is more interesting than the guess: the wait that
matters is **after asking the field to select everything**, and the other two are not needed at all.
That is worth believing — it came from a phone, not from reasoning — but worth a second look before
shipping, because 0 on step 3 contradicts the on-screen advice that step 3 is the one to raise
first. Either the advice is wrong or his fields are unusually quick. Ask him.

## Settings order

The order he has dragged into place:

1. Edit settings order
2. Paste timing
3. Switchboard
4. Magic button
5. Feature row
6. API keys
7. Recording
8. Custom mappings
9. Output
10. History
11. Recovered recordings
12. Learn my words
13. Word predictions

Then the inherited FlorisBoard block: Keyboard, Smartbar, Gestures, Typing, Clipboard.

Note that **Switchboard sits third, not first**, although it was shipped first. He moved it below
Paste timing. Ship his order, not the alphabetical or the logical one.

## Magic button terms worth shipping

Confirmed working against real screens, with the app he uses them in:

**Claude (com.anthropic.claude)** — `Send`, `Stop responding`, `Copy message`.
Also available: `New chat`, `Share`, `Narrate`, `Retry message`, `Add to chat`, `Scroll to bottom`.

**imgtoimg.ai in Firefox** — `Use Image URL`, `Upload Image`, `Generate Images`, `Re-edit`,
`Regenerate`, `Download`.

The first three already ship. The imgtoimg ones are his second daily workflow and are the obvious
next defaults — but they belong to a **web page**, not an app, so scoping them to
`org.mozilla.firefox` would break the moment he opens the same site in another browser. Ship them
unscoped, or scope them to nothing at all, which is the same thing.

## One thing not to forget

`Open menu, new feature available` was in an earlier Claude dump and is a trap: the label changes
when Anthropic stops showing the badge. Never ship a term containing words like "new feature
available" — match on the stable part or not at all.
