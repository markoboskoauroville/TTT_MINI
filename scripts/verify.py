Run before every push. Every check here exists because a red build taught it.

    python3 scripts/verify.py

Exit 0 and it is worth pushing. Exit 1 and CI would have told you the same thing five minutes
later, having spent five minutes.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Six of the last thirty builds were red, and not one of them was a design mistake. They were all the
same shape: a scripted edit that left a duplicate declaration, an orphaned annotation, an import
that was added twice or removed while still used, or a symbol used above the line that declares it.

Brace and paren balancing — the check this project already had — passes for every one of them,
because nothing about the *shape* of the file is wrong. These checks look at what the shape cannot
see.

    Sixteen unresolved references, every one of them a symbol the cut had deleted.

    This is the failure the handoff names — *cutting code by eye fails* — and none of the other
    checks here could see it. Braces balance perfectly when a whole declaration is removed. Nothing
    was duplicated, no import was orphaned, the file is well formed. It is simply missing something
    the rest of it still uses.

    So: every `val`/`var` declared at HEAD and not declared now, whose bare name is still referenced
    in the file, is a cut that took too much.

    Bare name only. `MaClipCapture.autoRank` is a qualified reference to somebody else's property and
    is not this file's business — a local declaration deliberately moved into an object would
    otherwise report itself forever.

# character, five minutes of CI, one paid build. The obvious guard is to collect the repo's function
# names and flag any `.name` used without parentheses.
#
# Swept over the whole app it produced **434 hits**, essentially all of them correct code: a name
# that is a function in one file is a property on a library type in another, and this script cannot
# see library signatures to tell them apart.
#
# A check with 434 false positives is not a weak check, it is a harmful one. It would have to be
# argued with on every file, and a check that is argued with stops being read — at which point the
# real hits arrive in the same voice as the noise. The same reasoning that narrowed the delegation
# check and the duplicate-declaration check applies here, and here it ends in deletion rather than
# narrowing, because there is nothing left to narrow it BY.
#
# This gap stays open. Kotlin catches it instantly and CI reports it in five minutes; that is the
# cost, and it is smaller than the cost of a script nobody believes.

# what a wildcard import, a same-package declaration or a Kotlin stdlib name brings in, so the
# difference is full of names that resolve perfectly well.
#
# Measured before writing it rather than after: `check_symbols_resolve` already covers the cases
# where the answer is knowable from inside this repo, and widening it to every androidx symbol
# reintroduces the noise that got check_property_call deleted an hour earlier.
