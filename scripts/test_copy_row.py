"""
Test 1 for the copy row: the mechanism, alone, before any build.

The claim being tested is not "it compiles" and not "it looks right". It is the thing Marko asked
for in one sentence:

    THERE IS ONE COPY ROW IN THE WHOLE APP, IT APPEARS IN BOTH VIEWS, AND IT HAS ONE SWITCH.

That is a structural claim, so it can be checked without a phone and without CI. Each check below
would have caught the bug that was shipped: two rows from two preferences and two key vocabularies,
both called the copy row, ending in different keys.
