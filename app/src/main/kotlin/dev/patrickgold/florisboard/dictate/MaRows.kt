/**
 * The feature rows: three of them, each a preset, each switchable on its own.
 *
 * This is the app's main feature and its model is deliberately flat. Everything that can sit on a
 * row is a button of equal standing — the app's own keys, the ten clipboard slots C1 to C10, and the
 * ten macro slots M1 to M10. Nothing nests inside anything else and nothing is protected.
 *
 * ### What replaced what, and why
 *
 * An earlier design made the clipboard a child row of the feature row that expanded and collapsed.
 * That is gone. Clipboard slots are now simply buttons, so they can be put anywhere, mixed with
 * anything, in any of the three rows, and a row of five clipboard keys beside a backspace is as
 * valid an arrangement as any other. The nesting bought nothing and cost the freedom to arrange.
 *
 * ### Rows collapse upward
 *
 * Three rows exist always. Switching one off does not leave a gap: the rows that remain move up and
 * take the space, so with only row two enabled it is drawn where row one would have been. The order
 * among the survivors never changes, which is what makes the arrangement predictable — switching row
 * one off must not reshuffle two and three.
 *
 * ### Nothing is protected, except the way back
 *
 * There is no locked key. Every button, including backspace and enter, can be unticked. The single
 * guarantee is that if the user switches off everything, in every row, the settings key appears on
 * its own — because a keyboard with no keys at all and no route to the settings that would restore
 * them is a keyboard that can only be fixed by uninstalling the app. That is a floor, not a lock:
 * the settings key is an ordinary button the rest of the time and can be placed, moved and unticked
 * like any other.
