 * The quick row of the transcribe view: the language toggle, the four case buttons, and the current
 * transcription model as a dropdown.
 *
 * Changing model used to mean leaving the keyboard for the settings app entirely, and the language
 * meant tapping a chip repeatedly to cycle a list. Both are checks worth making in the second before
 * speaking, so both belong in the view where the speaking happens.
 *
 * **One language key, not one per language.** It drew a button for every enabled language and lit
 * the active one, which is a radio group drawn the expensive way: it spends the width of every
 * option to say what one word already says. That shape is only right while there might be a third
 * language. There are two and permanently two, so a toggle is the honest control, and the width it
 * gives back goes to the keys either side of it on the narrowest surface in the app.

        // the wrong words, so FAST plus Croatian was a setting that quietly ruined the dictation and
