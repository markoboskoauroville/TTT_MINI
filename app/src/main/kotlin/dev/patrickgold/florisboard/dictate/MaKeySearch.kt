/**
 * Finding a key in the picker by typing what you want, rather than by reading forty-six of them.
 *
 * ### Three layers, cheapest first
 *
 *  1. **What he typed, matched literally** against the label, the description, the letters on the
 *     face and the id. Instant, offline, and right nearly always.
 *  2. **What he has meant before.** Every time he picks a key while a query is showing, the pair is
 *     remembered. So "sound off" reaches the volume key on the second try forever, whatever the
 *     label says. This is the part that makes the third layer wither: **the model is a teacher, not
 *     a dependency.**
 *  3. **Ask a model**, only when the first two find nothing, and mark the answer `(AI)` so a guess
 *     is never mistaken for a match.
 *
 * ### Why the memory is not a spell-checker
 *
 * He is dyslexic and dictates in two languages. A corrector would try to turn his word into the
 * app's word, which is the wrong direction: **his word is not a mistake, it is what that key is
 * called in his head.** So nothing is corrected. The pair is stored and his word becomes a real name
 * for that key, as good as the printed one and better for him.
 *
 * Everything here is pure — strings in, strings out, no Android and no network — so the whole rule
 * can be walked in Python before a build.
