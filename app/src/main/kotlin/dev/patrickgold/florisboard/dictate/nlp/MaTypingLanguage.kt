/**
 * THE LANGUAGE HE IS TYPING, READ FROM WHAT HE TYPES: ENGLISH, OR NOT ENGLISH.
 *
 * Marko, 27.10.2026: "I would like the app to detect whether I'm typing in English or another
 * language. For now the only other language is Croatian, so it is just English or not English. If
 * I'm typing something that is not English, it should give me Croatian suggestions."
 *
 * Until now the suggestions followed the HR/ENG badge, which is also the transcription language. He
 * writes a Croatian message with the badge on ENG and the row offers English. This reads the last
 * few words before the cursor and decides the SUGGESTION language only: the badge, the keyboard
 * layout and the transcription language are not touched.
 *
 * ### How it decides
 *
 *  - Any of č ć ž š đ: Croatian. Certain.
 *  - Otherwise the finished words (the one being typed is left out: "h" is half of everything) are
 *    weighed. A small word of one language (the, and, is / je, se, da) counts most. A word only
 *    one of his personal models knows counts too.
 *  - English wins only on English evidence. A word neither language knows leans Croatian, a little:
 *    "not English" is Croatian, as he put it; but a typo in an English sentence is outweighed by the
 *    English words around it.
 *  - No evidence (an empty field, a single fresh word): the last decision stands, and at the very
 *    start the badge. So the row does not flicker between languages on every letter.
 *
 * [decide] is pure (MaTypingLanguageTest); [of] adds the setting, the models and the memory.
