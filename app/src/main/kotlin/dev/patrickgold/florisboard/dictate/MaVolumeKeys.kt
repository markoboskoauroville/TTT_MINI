/**
 * The volume keys. His main shortcut, and the specification is in `VOLUME_KEYS.md`.
 *
 * ### There is no setting
 *
 * There was one, and it is the reason this was dead for five builds. It defaulted on, it sat in a
 * list of thirteen switches he had just been given the ability to drag, and one stray touch turned
 * it off. Nothing said so. He lost days believing the feature had been deleted, and I spent three
 * rounds reading a handler that was correct the whole time.
 *
 * **A control that can silently disable the thing somebody uses most is not a feature, it is a
 * trapdoor.** The switch is gone. These keys are always live while the keyboard is on screen.
 *
 * ### What they do
 *
 * **Volume up, quick tap** — start recording. Tap again — stop, and send to transcription.
 *
 * **Volume down, quick tap while recording** — stop, transcribe, and when the words land, press Send
 * on screen with the accessibility finger. One press for the whole errand.
 *
 * **Volume down, quick tap otherwise** — press Send on screen.
 *
 * **Either, held** — the real volume, repeating, with the system's own bar showing.
 *
 * ### Why the decision happens on RELEASE
 *
 * At the moment of pressing there is no way to know which of the two he meant. A quick tap is a tap;
 * a finger still down after [HOLD_MS] was never a tap at all. Deciding on release is what lets one
 * key do both jobs without either guessing.
 *
 * Two invariants, and they are the feature: **never both** — no press produces an app action and a
 * volume change — and **always one** — no press does nothing at all.

     * ### This is the setting VOLUME_KEYS.md forbids, and it is here on purpose
     *
     * That document says plainly: there is no preference, do not add one back. It says so because a
     * switch buried in a draggable list of thirteen was turned off by one stray touch, silently, and
     * cost him days believing the feature had been deleted while three rounds were spent reading a
     * handler that was correct the whole time.
     *
     * He has asked for it back, and the reason is real: the keys are live whenever the keyboard is
     * up, and sometimes he wants the volume to be the volume. So the rule that matters is not "no
     * switch" — it is **the thing that failed was a switch he could not see.** That is what this
     * avoids:
     *
     *  - **The key on the row is the only control.** No switchboard entry, no settings screen, no
     *    gestures list. It cannot be brushed while dragging something else, because it is not in a
     *    list of switches.
     *  - **It shows its own state, on the row, in front of him.** Green means the keys are live.
     *    The old switch's fatal property was that nothing on screen changed when it flipped.
     *  - **It only exists if he puts it there.** A key that is not on his row cannot turn anything
     *    off.
     *
     * Persisted, deliberately. A state that resets itself when the keyboard restarts is a control
     * that lies — he would switch the keys off for a film and find them live again at the next text
     * field, with no press of his to explain it.
     *
     * Read fresh on every press rather than cached. This is read a few times a second at most, and a
     * cached copy is how a toggle comes to disagree with the key that draws it.
