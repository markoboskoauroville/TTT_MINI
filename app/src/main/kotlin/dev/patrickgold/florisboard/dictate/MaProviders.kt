/**
 * Which provider does which job, and on which path.
 *
 * ### Why this is its own file
 *
 * `DictateController` was 3,821 lines holding recording, transcription, history, prompts, audio
 * routing and this. Splitting it is worth doing carefully rather than quickly: most of that file is
 * coupled to private state — `_state`, the output sink, the transcribe path — and moving those
 * elsewhere would mean making the controller's internals public purely to relocate code, which
 * trades one problem for a worse one.
 *
 * **This block was chosen because it reads nothing but preferences.** No state, no sink, no
 * coroutine scope. It answers questions — which account, which preset, which model, may this take
 * the fast path — and answers them from settings alone, which is exactly the shape that belongs
 * outside a controller.
 *
 * ### What it must never become
 *
 * A place where anything is *decided by side effect*. Everything here is a pure question about
 * configuration. The moment something in this file writes a preference or touches the UI, it has
 * stopped being resolution and should go back.

     * always async. English may use Sync while the clip fits its window, and the length check below
     * turns that into "fast until about two minutes, then slow" without any timer of its own.
