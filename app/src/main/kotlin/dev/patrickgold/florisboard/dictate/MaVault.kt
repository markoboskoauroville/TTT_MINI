/**
 * A plain folder in the shared Documents directory that outlives the app.
 *
 * Everything the app normally remembers, preferences and the persisted SAF grant on the picked keys
 * file, is destroyed by a full uninstall. That is why the API keys had to be entered again after a
 * clean install. A file written to `Documents/TTTmini/` is not touched by Android when the
 * package is removed, so a fresh install can pick the keys straight back up with no clicks at all.
 *
 * The catch is reading it back. Once the package is uninstalled the MediaStore ownership record for
 * that file is gone, so on Android 11 and newer the app is no longer allowed to read its own former
 * file without all-files access. That permission is therefore offered, once, from the settings
 * screen, and everything here degrades quietly when it has not been granted: writing still works
 * through the app's own scoped access on most devices, and the SAF picker remains the fallback.
 *
 * Nothing here is encrypted, deliberately. The whole point is that the file stays readable after the
 * app is gone. It sits in Documents where the user put it, exactly like the keys file that is picked
 * manually today.
