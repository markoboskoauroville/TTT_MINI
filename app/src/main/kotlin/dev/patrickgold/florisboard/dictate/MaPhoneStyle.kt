/**
 * STYLE AFTER EVERY DICTATION, THE MAC'S WAY. §191.
 *
 * MARKO_TRANSCRIBE on the Mac sends every message through a small model on the Mac
 * (server/styled.py): misheard words, spelling, capitals and punctuation, repetitions and confused
 * explanations, in the Yshai Afterman style with normal capitals. He asked for the same here, on the
 * phone, with the same model. [INSTRUCTION] is the Mac's rules word for word, and [correct] its
 * standing corrections; change them there and here together.
 *
 * Its model is chosen like every prompt's (Settings → Prompts), and ships as Qwen3 4B on the phone.
 * It runs only when that model is downloaded; until then nothing changes.
 *
 * When it runs and succeeds it does the Croatian spell check's job as well, so the spell check is
 * not sent too. When it fails, the spell check runs as before: a dictation is never left with
 * neither.
