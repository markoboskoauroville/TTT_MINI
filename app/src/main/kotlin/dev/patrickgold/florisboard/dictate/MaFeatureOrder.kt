/**
 * The keys of the feature row, as data, and the order they are drawn in.
 *
 * The count is deliberately not written down anywhere, here or on screen. It has been wrong twice
 * already, once by a key being added and once by this fork removing several, and a number in prose
 * is the one part of a document nothing ever recompiles.
 *
 * The order has been corrected by hand twice, at builds 139 and 146, from screenshots with arrows
 * drawn on them. Both corrections went the opposite way to what looked sensible from inside the
 * code, which is the argument for this file: the person using the keyboard should not have to send a
 * screenshot and wait for a build to move a key.
 *
 * **Order only. Nothing can be hidden, and that is a safety rule rather than a simplification.**
 * This row is the one that survives when every other row is folded away. `MIC` is the only way to
 * reach the dictation screen with zone two shut, and `BACKSPACE` and `ENTER` are the only keys from
 * the keyboard proper with no substitute anywhere. An editor that could hide those could leave the
 * keyboard with no way to delete a character, no way to end a line, and no way to reach the feature
 * that the app is named after, with no way back except the settings app. Rearranging cannot lock
 * anybody out of anything; hiding can.
