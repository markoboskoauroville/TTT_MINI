/**
 * The record button's instrument panel: readings on top, meter along the bottom.
 *
 * The previous version put the numbers in the middle of the bar, on top of the moving trace, where
 * they were genuinely hard to read: dark text over a bar that is green in one place and pale in
 * another has no reliable contrast anywhere. Nothing overlaps now. The readings live on their own
 * line above, in bold, and the meter has the bottom of the box to itself.
 *
 * Three readings, each on the side where it belongs:
 *
 *   left    level in dB, the thing that changes fastest and is glanced at rather than read
 *   centre  elapsed time, the one number always wanted, so it gets the middle
 *   right   size on disk in megabytes while recording, and transfer figures while sending
 *
 * While sending, the meter has no microphone to show, so it becomes a stereo-style bar spreading out
 * from the centre: decoration rather than data, and honest about it, but it keeps the panel alive
 * during the wait rather than freezing at whatever the last syllable happened to be.
