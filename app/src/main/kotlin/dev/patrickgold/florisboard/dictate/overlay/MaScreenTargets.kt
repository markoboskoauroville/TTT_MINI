/**
 * Finds a control on screen by what it says, and presses it.
 *
 * ### Why this rather than recognising the picture of a button
 *
 * Marko asked for template matching: crop the orange send button, look for that shape on screen,
 * tap it. That would work, and it is the harder and weaker of the two ways.
 *
 * Reading pixels needs `MediaProjection`, which throws a system consent dialog every session and
 * cannot be held open by a keyboard. Then the match has to survive a theme change, a font change, a
 * different screen density, the button being half scrolled off, and the same button drawn a shade
 * darker while it is pressed. Every one of those is a miss, and a miss looks exactly like the key
 * being broken.
 *
 * Android already hands us something better for free. Every control carries the label a screen
 * reader would announce, plus its exact rectangle on screen. `Add URL`, `Generate Images` and a send
 * arrow are all findable by that label with no pixels at all, and the answer is right whatever the
 * theme, the density or the scroll position. This is the same information a blind user's phone uses
 * to describe the screen, so it is maintained by the app author rather than guessed at by us.
 *
 * ### One key, several buttons
 *
 * The targets are a list and the first one found on screen wins. Marko's three buttons are never on
 * screen at the same time, so one key presses whichever is showing: the magic button.

    /**
     * Learning a button by watching it be pressed.
     *
     * ### Why this replaces reading a list
     *
     * The list was the wrong shape of help. A screen holds dozens of pressable things, the labels
     * are written for a screen reader rather than for a person choosing from a list, and Marko had
     * to work out which of thirty entries was the orange circle he actually wanted. He asked for the
     * opposite: touch the thing, and be told what it is called.
     *
     * A keyboard cannot watch a finger land on another app — the touch belongs to that app. But the
     * accessibility service is told, after the fact, when a control has been clicked, and the event
     * carries the control. So he presses the button for real, it does what it always does, and its
     * name arrives here as a side effect. Nothing is intercepted and nothing behaves differently.
     *
     * ### Why it is armed rather than always on
     *
     * Recording every click anybody makes would be both useless and unpleasant. It is armed by a
     * long press, listens for one click, and disarms — by success, by the timeout, or by being armed
     * again.

     * The whole accessibility tree of what is on screen, as text, with nothing filtered out.

     * ### Why a dump rather than a cleverer filter
     *
     * Three attempts at guessing which nodes matter have now failed on Marko's phone: everything
     * clickable was too much, page-only missed things, furniture lists caught the wrong ones. The
     * label a button carries is often nothing like the word on its face, and no rule written in
     * this file can know that.
     *
     * So this stops guessing. He copies the tree, sends it with a screenshot, and is told exactly
     * which name to use. The intelligence moves out of the heuristics and into the conversation,
     * which is where it was working all along.
     *
     * Every node is included, clickable or not, named or not. A node with no label is exactly the
     * kind of thing that turns out to be the button, and a dump that had already decided what
     * mattered would be the same mistake in a new place.
