/**
 * A word predictor that knows only what this phone has written.
 *
 * Every shipped prediction model is trained on everybody, which is why they are confident about
 * "how are you" and useless on Kukljica, montaža, binovi, Auroville. This one has the opposite
 * shape: it knows nothing about language in general and a great deal about the words actually used
 * here, including the ones no dictionary contains.
 *
 * ## How it predicts
 *
 * Three tables of counts, and a walk down them.
 *
 *  - the trigram table: what followed these two words
 *  - the bigram table: what followed this one word
 *  - the unigram table: what gets written at all
 *
 * A prediction tries the trigram first, because two words of context is the most specific evidence
 * available. If that yields too little it falls back to the bigram, then to the unigram. This is
 * stupid backoff: cruder than the smoothing a language model would use, and the right choice here,
 * because it needs no tuning, degrades predictably on a model that starts empty, and costs a map
 * lookup rather than a matrix.
 *
 * Longer context is preferred rather than merely added: a trigram hit outranks any bigram hit, and
 * a bigram hit outranks any unigram. Without that a common word would drown out the specific one
 * every time, and the specific one is the entire reason this exists.
 *
 * ## What it learns from
 *
 * Typing and dictation both. Dictation matters more: this phone produces far more words by speaking
 * than by tapping, so most of what the model knows will arrive as transcripts.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * Nothing leaves the device, and nothing is learned in incognito mode.
 *
 * Croatian case endings are a known weakness and are deliberately not addressed. Kuću, kući and
 * kuća are three unrelated strings to a counter, so the counts spread thinner than they would in
 * English. Fixing that means stemming, stemming means a Croatian morphology table, and a wrong
 * table would merge words that are genuinely different. Thin counts recover with use; wrong merges
 * do not.
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *
 * Learning happens on whatever thread committed the text and prediction happens on the NLP scope, so
 * every table is guarded by one read-write lock. Predictions take the read lock and can overlap;
 * learning takes the write lock. The lock is held only around the map operations, never across file
 * access.
