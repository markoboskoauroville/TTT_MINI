/**
 * The AI key at the end of the prediction row.
 *
 * ### The shape, which is the same shape as the key search
 *
 * The local n-gram model predicts from what he has actually written, and it is right most of the
 * time and free every time. When it is not right, he presses one key and a model is asked for
 * candidates instead — and **whichever one he picks is taught back to the local model.**
 *
 * So this is not "AI prediction". It is a way of teaching the local model quickly, on the words it
 * happens to be wrong about, at the moment he notices. The n-gram learns from his committed text
 * anyway; this reaches the same place in one press instead of over weeks, and only where it matters.
 *
 * > **The model is a teacher for the database, not a replacement for it.**
 *
 * The same rule as `MaKeySearch`, and written down in `MANTRA_MANIFEST/modules/find-by-typing.md`.
 *
 * ### Why it is a key and not automatic
 *
 * Every press costs money and a wait of a second or two. Automatic would spend both on every word,
 * including the overwhelming majority the local model already gets right, and would put a pause into
 * typing — the one thing a keyboard may never do. **He asks when he wants it**, which is also the
 * only moment anybody knows the local guess was wrong.
 *
 * ### The state
 *
 * Compose state in an object rather than a flow through NlpManager, because these suggestions do not
 * come from a provider, do not participate in auto-commit, and must not be learned from as though
 * the engine had produced them. They are a temporary overlay on the row, cleared the moment he picks
 * one, types anything, or presses the key again.
