/**
 * Where the settings were left, so the gear key can put him back there.
 *
 * Reaching a setting is the expensive part on a phone driven by voice and read with difficulty.
 * Changing it once you are looking at it is not. So the gear key does not open the settings home and
 * leave him to find his way down again: it opens the screen he was last on, scrolled to where he was
 * on it.
 *
 * **Both halves or it is not worth having.** The right screen at the top of itself still costs a
 * scroll on a page he was at the bottom of, and the settings home when he was three levels into the
 * key manager is the same as remembering nothing at all.
 *
 * ### Why SharedPreferences rather than the datastore
 *
 * This is written from the keyboard process and read from the settings activity, and it is written
 * on every scroll settle. It is scratch state about where somebody was standing, not a preference
 * anybody chose, and it has no business in the exported settings the datastore holds.
 *
 * ### The offset is stored against the route it was measured on
 *
 * A scroll position means nothing on a different page. Four hundred pixels down the provider list is
 * the middle of it and four hundred pixels down a short screen is the bottom or nowhere, so an
 * offset applied to the wrong route does not look like a bug, it looks like the app jumped. Both
 * values are written together and the offset is only ever handed back when the route matches.
