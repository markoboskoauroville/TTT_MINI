/**
 * One hairline across the top of the screen, while a recording is running with no keyboard in sight.
 *
 * ### Why it exists
 *
 * The volume keys record whether or not the keyboard is on screen, and that turned out to be the
 * feature — he can start dictating without opening anything. But a recording nobody can see is a
 * recording he does not know he started, and the first he learns of it is a transcript arriving from
 * a conversation he had with somebody else in the room.
 *
 * **Anything that captures a microphone must be visible while it does.** Not as a courtesy — as the
 * minimum honesty of a device that listens.
 *
 * ### Why a line and not a bubble
 *
 * There is already a floating button, and it is a control: it can be dragged, pressed, and it takes
 * a corner of the screen. This is not a control. It carries one bit of information — *this is
 * recording* — and the smallest shape that carries one bit is a line.
 *
 * Three device-pixels tall, at the very bottom, across the full width. Not touchable, not focusable,
 * and it never covers anything: at that height it sits in the gesture bar's own margin.
 *
 * ### Why only when the keyboard is hidden
 *
 * With the keyboard up he can already see the recorder — the timer, the waveform, the red dot. A
 * second indicator would be a second thing saying what the first one says.

/**
 * The VU meter, on the overlay, reading the same numbers as the one on the keyboard.
 *
 * ### It is the module, not a lookalike
 *
 * The level comes from `DictateController.audioLevel` — the same StateFlow the keyboard's meter
 * collects. The dB conversion, the floor, the peak decay and the three colours are lifted from
 * `MaRecordMeter` unchanged, so the two cannot disagree about how loud he is: **one source of
 * numbers, drawn twice, rather than two meters that happen to look similar.**
 *
 * It is drawn with a Canvas rather than composed because this window has no lifecycle owner for
 * Compose to attach to. That is a difference in the brush, not in the picture.
 *
 * ### Peak hold
 *
 * A bar alone tells you the current instant, which at speech rates is a flicker. The peak mark falls
 * at 0.6 dB per frame — slow enough to read, fast enough to follow a sentence — and it is what makes
 * the thing a meter rather than a light.
