/**
 * THE EXACT MESSAGE CTRL+P AND CTRL+F SEND, BUILT IN ONE PLACE.
 *
 * He asked to see what is sent to Claude, word for word, and to change it. The instruction was
 * already his to edit, but it was never the whole message: two more pieces were added behind it
 * that no screen showed. So the message is built HERE, and the keyboard and the settings preview
 * both call [build]. The preview cannot drift from what is sent, because it is the same function.
 *
 * ### The four parts, in order
 *
 *  1. **The instruction** — the ticked wording of Ctrl+P or Ctrl+F (Settings → Prompts).
 *  2. **The rewording system prompt** — "be precise", or his own, or nothing (Settings → Rewording).
 *  3. **The language line** — names the language of the text. Editable on the Prompts screen.
 *  4. **The text** — the selection, or the whole field.
 *
 * Sent as one user message, blank lines between the parts.
 *
 * ### The sentence that told Claude to answer in English
 *
 * The shipped "be precise" prompt ends: *Output the text in the language of the instruction.* The
 * instruction is in English. So every Ctrl+P on Croatian carried an order to answer in English,
 * followed by the language line ordering the opposite — and the model had to pick one. That
 * sentence is for prompts that write something new ("write an email to…"). When there is text to
 * work on, it is dropped, and the language line is the only word on language.
