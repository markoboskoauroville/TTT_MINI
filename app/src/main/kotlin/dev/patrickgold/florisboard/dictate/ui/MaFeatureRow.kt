/**
 * The feature row: one row, drawn by both views and the last row standing when everything
 * above it is folded away.
 *
 * `AP · select-all · backspace · mic · book · 1 2 3 · enter`, **by default**. The order now lives in a
 * preference and is rearranged by the user in Settings, Mantra, Feature row; what follows is the
 * reasoning behind the default and the shape of the row, not a description of what is on screen.
 *
 * **This order is Marko's and it has been corrected twice.** At build 139 the switches were on the
 * left and the borrowed keys on the right, and he swapped them. At build 146 he moved the microphone
 * in beside backspace, put the book next to it, and sent enter to the far end. Do not rearrange this
 * row on a theory; it is arranged by the person using it.
 *
 * What the current order means, so a future change can tell what it would be breaking:
 *
 * - **The busy end is the end the thumb starts from.** AP, select-all and backspace are used inside
 *   a sentence; the numbered switches are reached a few times a session.
 * - **The two view swaps sit together.** The microphone and the book are the only keys here that
 *   change which view is on screen, and a pair that does one kind of thing is found by feel. They
 *   were at opposite ends of the row before, which is the arrangement that made that hard.
 * - **Enter is bottom right**, where every keyboard ever made has put it. Borrowing a habit somebody
 *   already has beats any argument about grouping.
 * - **The numbers read left to right** as the parts of the keyboard they control.
 * - **AP, select-all, backspace and enter are the keys that must survive a fold.** The first two are
 *   the copy row's most used pair; the last two are the only keys from the keyboard proper with no
 *   substitute anywhere else once zone two is shut.
 *
 * The rule it exists to satisfy is Marko's, and it is a good one: a feature you have to enable in a
 * settings app before you can see it is a feature most people never find. The dictation view is not
 * the full keyboard, so it has the vertical room the typing view does not, and this spends some of
 * that room on reach.
 *
 * Three things borrowed from keyboards that have already been judged by very large numbers of
 * people:
 *
 * - **Gboard put its shortcuts in key-shaped buttons and then deleted its overflow menu**, freeing
 *   the slot it occupied. A shortcut behind a menu is a shortcut to a menu. Every key here acts on
 *   the first tap; none of them opens a list of more keys except the dashboard, which is a list of
 *   switches rather than of actions.
 * - **HeliBoard distributes its toolbar keys evenly** rather than packing them from one edge. Equal
 *   weights below, so the row reads as a row and the thumb learns positions rather than icons.
 * - **Ten keys is exactly what the letter row already is.** The usual objection to ten controls in a
 *   phone-width row is that each falls under the 48dp touch minimum, and at a typical 360dp width
 *   these are about 36dp. But the QWERTY row above is ten keys at the same width, on the same
 *   device, in the same hand, and it has been usable for as long as touch keyboards have existed.
 *   The precedent is not theoretical, it is one row up.
 *
 * Colour is state only, as everywhere else in this app: gold ink on the near-black key, and green
 * on the three keys that are switches so their positions are readable without pressing them.

 * takes you somewhere else, the way red marks recording and green marks a level that is safe. A
 * label saying "Wand" had to be read to know what it did; a gear in the colour of leaving does not.

/**
 * A glyph with the history mark on it: [base] for the subject, the circular arrow for the past.
 *
 * ### Why a composed glyph rather than a Material one
 *
 * Material has `History` — the arrow round a clock — and nothing for "the history of a clipboard".
 * The alternatives were all wrong in the same way: `ContentPasteGo` says go, `ContentPasteSearch`
 * says find, `Restore` says undo. **None of them says "the ones before".**
 *
 * So the mark is applied rather than looked up, which also makes it a rule instead of a coincidence:
 * anything that opens a history takes the same arrow, and a reader who learns it once on the
 * transcription key reads it everywhere without being taught again.
 *
 * ### The proportions
 *
 * The arrow sits at the bottom-left at 60% and overlaps rather than sitting beside: a badge in the
 * corner of a glyph reads as one picture, a second glyph beside it reads as two keys crammed into
 * one. It is drawn over a small disc of the key's own background so the two sets of strokes do not
 * tangle where they cross — without it the arrow's tail reads as part of the clipboard's rim at key
 * size.
 *
 * Bottom-LEFT because the clipboard's clip is top-centre and its lines run right; the free corner is
 * the one the base glyph is quietest in, and that is where a badge belongs.
