/**
 * The language of this app, in one place.
 *
 * There were two languages before, and they were allowed to disagree. One decided what the speech
 * service was told it was listening to, the other decided which dictionary the suggestions came
 * from, and each had its own control. Two controls for one intention is one too many: nobody speaks
 * Croatian while wanting English suggestions, and the setup where that is possible is the setup
 * where one of the two is quietly wrong and there is no way to see which.
 *
 * So there is one switch, and what it moves is the **dictation** language: what the speech service
 * is told to expect. Every control that changes it goes through this object rather than writing the
 * preference directly.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT move the keyboard's own language. That was tried and was wrong: typing
 * and speaking are two acts at two moments, and a control meant for the microphone must not relay
 * the keys.
 *
 * Two languages, Croatian and English, because that is what this app is for. Auto-detect is not one
 * of them: it exists in the catalog for the settings screen, but the toggle deliberately cannot land
 * on it, since a toggle whose third state means "I do not know" cannot be operated without looking.
