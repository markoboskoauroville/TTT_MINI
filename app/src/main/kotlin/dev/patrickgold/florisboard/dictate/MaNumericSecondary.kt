/**
 * What each digit on the number row types when it is held.
 *
 * Ten slots, one per digit, in printed order: 1 to 9 and then 0. A slot may hold any string, or be
 * empty for a key with nothing behind it.
 *
 * Stored as the ten slots joined by a unit separator rather than by a comma. A second symbol is
 * exactly the kind of thing somebody assigns a comma to, and a separator that can appear inside a
 * value is a corruption waiting to happen. U+001F cannot be typed, so it can never collide with
 * what is stored.
 *
 * Parsing never fails and never throws. A stored string of the wrong length is padded or trimmed to
 * ten, because a preference written by an older build, or by hand, should degrade to something
 * usable rather than take the keyboard down with it.
