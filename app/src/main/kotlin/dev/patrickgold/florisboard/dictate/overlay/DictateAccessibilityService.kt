/**
 * Optional accessibility service that powers the floating dictation button (issue #88). It does two
 * things the keyboard cannot do from outside an active IME:
 *
 *  1. **Detect** when an editable text field holds input focus in *any* app, so the floating button can
 *     appear only when there is somewhere to dictate into ([editableFocused]).
 *  2. **Inject** the transcribed text into that focused field ([injectText]) — the equivalent of the
 *     IME's `commitText`, but driven from the overlay where no InputConnection exists.
 *
 * The service is entirely opt-in: it does nothing until the user enables both the floating-button
 * feature and this service in the system accessibility settings. It only ever reads the *focused*
 * field (to know it is editable and to place text at the cursor); it does not collect screen content.
 *
 * It also owns the floating bubble ([DictateBubbleController]) and promotes itself to a microphone
 * foreground service while a bubble-driven dictation records, so background mic capture is allowed.

     *
     * A real `KEYCODE_TAB` is already reachable through the macro syntax, and in Suno it does
     * nothing useful — it moves the caret inside the field it is already in. That is not a bug in
     * the app: Tab moves focus on Android only between views marked focusable in touch mode, and
     * almost nothing is, because until recently nobody had a Tab key on a phone.
     *
     * Reading the node tree sidesteps the question entirely. It does not matter whether the app
     * handles Tab, whether it is native or a web view, or whether anyone ever considered a keyboard:
     * the fields are in the tree because the tree is what screen readers use, and every app has to
     * provide it.
     *
     * ### Order
     *
     * Depth-first through the tree, which is the order the fields were declared and, in practice,
     * the order they appear down the screen. That matches what the eye expects and what Tab does on
     * a desktop.
     *
     * ### Wrapping
     *
     * From the last field it returns to the first, so the key always does something. On a screen
     * with two fields — lyrics and style — that makes one key a toggle between them, which is the
     * shape of the actual problem.

         * connection"*, which is true and useless.

         * accessibility service can see it and act on it. **The keyboard lost its handle on the

         *

         * that view thinks is selected — including a partial selection inside a formatted document,
         * which reading `text` and slicing by index gets wrong the moment the view's idea of an
         * index is not a character offset.
         *

         * the caller can fall back rather than believing a copy happened.
