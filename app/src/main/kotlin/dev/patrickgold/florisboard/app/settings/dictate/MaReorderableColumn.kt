/**
 * A list whose rows can be held and dragged into a different order.
 *
 * Extracted from the feature row editor when the settings list needed exactly the same thing. Two
 * copies of drag arithmetic is how the two quietly stop behaving alike, and this is the kind of code
 * where "quietly different" means one list swaps where the other shifts and nobody can say why.
 *
 * **Written by hand rather than pulled from a library, and the reason is [rowHeight].** With every
 * row the same fixed height, the target index is the drag distance divided by that height, and there
 * is nothing else to it. A library would buy a dependency, a migration and a set of behaviours to
 * learn, in exchange for one division. If these rows ever gain different heights this calculation has
 * to be **replaced** rather than adjusted, and that is the whole warning.
 *
 * The caller owns the order and is told when it changes: [onMove] fires during the drag so the list
 * moves under the finger, and [onSettled] fires when the finger lifts so the caller can persist once
 * instead of on every frame.
