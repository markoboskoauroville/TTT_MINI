/**
 * The feature row editor: three rows, three tabs, one row at a time.
 *
 * This is the app's main feature and the screen it is arranged from, so it is deliberately the
 * plainest thing in the settings. One tab is one row. Everything visible on the tab belongs to that
 * row and nothing else, which is what stops the screen becoming the crowded single list it was
 * before: with three rows of keys shown at once there was no way to see any of them.
 *
 * ### Same list, same gestures, as the rest of the app
 *
 * A numbered row, the key's own glyph, its name, a tick, and a handle to drag it by. That pattern is
 * already on the settings order screen and was on the feature row screen before this one, and
 * matching it was the whole point of the rewrite: an invented second style made the app look like
 * two apps. Dragging is [MaReorderableColumn], the same component the rest of the app drags with.
 *
 * ### Nothing is protected
 *
 * Every key can be unticked, backspace and enter included. The floor lives in the model rather than
 * here: switch everything off in all three rows and the keyboard draws the settings key alone, so
 * there is always a route back to this screen. A rule enforced by hiding tick boxes would be a rule
 * the user has to discover by failing.
 *
 * ### Unticked, not deleted
 *
 * A key switched off stays in the list, greyed. It keeps its position, so switching it back on puts
 * it where it was rather than at the end — a list whose entries move about cannot be learned by
 * position, and this one is navigated by position.

/**
 * Picking keys to add: the whole screen, three columns, ticks, and as many as you like at once.
 *
 * ### What was wrong with the version this replaces
 *
 * It was a dialog holding one narrow column of thirty-odd entries, and it could not be scrolled at
 * all: `verticalScroll()` was applied before `heightIn(max = 440.dp)`, so the content was measured
 * at the height of its own viewport and there was never anything to scroll to. Everything past the
 * first eight keys was unreachable. Modifier order is not cosmetic — the constraint has to come
 * first, then the scroll — and the failure looks exactly like a frozen screen rather than a bug.
 *
 * ### Why the whole screen
 *
 * There is no reason to add keys one at a time through a dialog occupying a third of a phone. Three
 * columns fit every key on one screen with no scrolling at all, ticks let a whole row be assembled
 * in one pass, and one Add applies the lot. Adding ten clipboard keys was ten open-pick-reopen
 * cycles; now it is ten taps and a button.

/**
 * Writes what one macro button does.
 *
 * The palette is the reason this is usable. MaMacroSyntax accepts a generous range of names, which
 * is right for reading a macro and useless for writing one, and `{Ctrl+Shift+Z}` cannot be dictated
 * — spoken into a field it arrives as prose. So the commands are picked from a grouped list, and
 * picking one fills the label in too when it is still blank, so the common case is one tap.
