/**
 * The Mantra settings list, as data, so its order belongs to the person using it.
 *
 * Same argument as the feature row and the same shape of solution. The order of a list of links is
 * not a thing the person who wrote the list can know: it depends entirely on which four of them
 * somebody opens every week and which four they have opened twice ever.
 *
 * **The group headings are gone with it, and that is the real change.** "Start here", "Dictation",
 * "Saved", "Keyboard extras" were a filing system, and a filing system contradicts a free order: as
 * soon as History can sit above Recording, a heading saying *Saved* is either a lie or a cage. A flat
 * list that the user arranges is the honest version, and on a phone it is also two screens shorter.
 *
 * **Order only, nothing hidden.** As with the feature row: rearranging cannot lose anything, and for
 * a settings list the stakes are the same in kind, since API keys is on it and a keyboard with no
 * reachable key screen is a keyboard that cannot be fixed from inside itself.
