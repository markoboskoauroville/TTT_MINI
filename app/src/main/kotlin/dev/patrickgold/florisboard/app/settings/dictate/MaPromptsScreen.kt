/**
 * Prompts, as categories holding named instances — the Avid model where it earns its keep.
 *
 * ### What this screen is
 *
 * Two categories, Ctrl+P and Ctrl+F. Each holds as many named wordings as he likes and exactly one
 * carries the checkmark, which is the one the key sends. Choosing another visibly takes the mark
 * from the last, because it is a radio and not a tick-box: there is one wording in force and the
 * control should say so rather than leave two looking equally chosen.
 *
 * ### Duplicate is the main verb, not delete
 *
 * Nobody edits a working configuration directly. They copy it, rename the copy and edit that, so the
 * thing that was working is still there when the experiment turns out worse. The Default cannot be
 * edited at all for the same reason — its editor offers exactly one action, which is to duplicate
 * it and open the copy.
 *
 * ### Why not a tree with twist-downs
 *
 * Because two categories are not a tree. Section 96 records the order: instances first, and the
 * folder structure only if enough categories end up holding several of them. Nineteen settings
 * screens behind collapsed triangles, most of them holding one thing, would put every setting one
 * tap further away and call it an improvement.
