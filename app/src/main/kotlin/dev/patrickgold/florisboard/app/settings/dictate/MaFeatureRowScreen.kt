/**
 * Settings, Mantra, Feature row: the keys, in a list, dragged into whatever order suits.
 *
 * This row's order has been corrected by hand twice, at builds 139 and 146, both times from a
 * screenshot with arrows drawn on it, and both times in the direction opposite to what looked
 * sensible from inside the code. That is the whole argument for this screen. The person holding the
 * keyboard should not have to send a picture and wait for a build to move a key.
 *
 * **Order only. Nothing here can hide a key**, and that is a safety rule rather than a missing
 * feature. This row is the one that survives when every other row is folded away, so it is the only
 * route to backspace, to enter, and to the microphone. An editor that could hide those could leave
 * somebody with a keyboard that cannot delete a character or end a line, and no way back except the
 * settings app. Rearranging cannot lock anyone out of anything. Hiding could.
 *
 * **The drag is written by hand rather than pulled from a library.** Nine items of one fixed height
 * is the case where a reorderable list is a division: the target index is the drag distance divided
 * by the row height, and there is nothing else to it. A library for this would be a dependency, a
 * migration and a set of behaviours to learn, in exchange for arithmetic that fits on one line.
 * [ROW_HEIGHT] being fixed is what buys that, so if these rows ever grow to different heights this
 * calculation has to be replaced rather than adjusted.
