/**
 * Whether the suggestion strip has anything to say. **The one place that decides**, and it has to
 * stay the one place.
 *
 * Marko's ask: the strip should appear when there is a suggestion or a recording, and otherwise not
 * exist. It was holding a full row of screen for a language badge and a stretch of nothing, on a
 * phone, above a keyboard that is already the bottom half of the display.
 *
 * **Why this is a separate function rather than a boolean inside [Smartbar].** Two pieces of code
 * have to agree about this row: the one that draws it and the one that reserves its height in
 * `FlorisImeSizing.smartbarRowCountAsState`. This project has already paid for them disagreeing
 * once, on the keyboard fold at build 138: the keys stopped being drawn while the height arithmetic
 * went on counting four rows, so the keys vanished and the space stayed. The fix then was to make
 * one thing decide, and that is what this is. Anything that changes when the strip appears changes
 * it **here**, and both callers follow.
 *
 * For the same reason there is **no animation** on this row. A 200 ms fade against a height that
 * changes in one frame is the same disagreement in slow motion, visible as a band of nothing while
 * the fade finishes. It appears and disappears with its height, in the same frame.
 *
 * The layouts that carry buttons rather than suggestions are always shown: in those the row is a
 * toolbar, and a toolbar that comes and goes is not a toolbar. Only the suggestion-carrying layouts
 * become dynamic, which is the pair this app actually uses.
